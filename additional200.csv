Right now, the sense I get here is 'it'll all be over soon enough'. There are plenty of ways modern civilization can collapse - some are slow, some long. Some leave a small portion of people around, some end people, some end most life, some end all life (for now).

204;"Basically, having a hard time understanding how collapse works in prosperous, western nations.

if there are events that happen which severely disrupt food sources in all grain producing places on earth, what's to stop the powerful individuals who own the means of production from hiring militias to protect their crops and exporting that food to the highest bidder and just letting everyone around them starve (paying those people in a mixture of rations and money, of course)

In this scenario, money is still useful and the collective thinking is that X piece of paper (i.e. $5 dollar bill) still holds value (even though it's bs)

&#x200B;

As I see it so far, collapse is going to kill of the majority of people, but it will be the globally impoverished primarily (in the beginning, whether there will be reaction determines if the rest will collapse at a later date) that are the overwhelming majority of the dead, at which point there could be some type of turning point.

&#x200B;

I apologise if this comes across in any way like I'm trying to imagine a future in which this happens at the expense of others but I'm fine (I hate the FYIGM mentality), I just genuinely don't understand the way that it will happen in the West, and I'm probably missing some big points on it, and every way I imagined it happening has a (horrific) counter argument (e.g. what about mass migration to the west? armies shooting people at borders to stop it)

206;"Does lack of society change come down to privilege?   Of course nothing is that simple, and we shouldn't reduce complex issues as such.   But I recently made a length post in a university reddit ([https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/ck6oef/do\_any\_of\_you\_students\_think\_about\_civilization/](https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/ck6oef/do_any_of_you_students_think_about_civilization/))  and am wondering what you guys think:

>We like to  think we are 'rational' but ultimately human action is based on our  primary drives which involves consumption of resources.  Everyone  (almost), ultimately wants to increase their standard of living and will  continue towards that goal irrespective of long term consequences.    This seems to be the general trend of human civilization, and the cause  of collapse of previous civilizations.  That is why ultimately, I see  the required social and political change near impossible.   One should  only observe how those cultures, aboriginal in particular, that lived in  harmony with the land have been largely destroyed, and assimilated by a  culture of consumption. 
> 
>Even  those sympathetic to environmental causes are not willing to sacrifice  their western lifestyles, which would be impossible for 7.5 billion  people on earth.   Once people have gotten use to their creature  comforts, they won't give it up.  Moreover, people are not hardwired to  care about people half way across the world currently being ravaged by  climate change.  They are stuck in their own cultural bubbles generated  by consumer culture.  There are so many products (e.g. IPhone) that come  to market because of enormous exploitation of nature and labour, that  people buy in droves regardless even though they don't require these  products to live happy lives.  Propaganda is highly sophisticated and  effective as it exploits the truth about the human animal - we are  driven by irrational desire. 
> 
>What  motivates you to do a law degree?  Presumably, because you want to  improve your circumstances, earn money etc.  Intellectually we can  appreciate all these issues, like climate change, but in my experience  its those primary drives, feelings and desires which dictate our  actions. 
> 
>Let me speak from  experience as someone who has done a law and business degree and worked  briefly in law firm.  In the end you will see that all these  ethical/social/political issues you might discuss at law school has  little to no bearing on the direction society takes and certainly  nothing to do with the day to day workings of a law firm, or any other  business entity embedded in the capitalism system.  The forces of  competition demand that the primary consideration in all decisions is  business and profit.  Hence in order to survive (comfortably) you must  be a part of this machinery and all your values can only be acted upon  outside the job - which for most means hardly acted upon at all. 
> 
>The  elites/the rich are very much in control.  The governments, the  corporations, are all subjected to the game of competition, and thus  financial capital (banks, investment houses) have essential control over  them.  States themselves have lost much of their power because of the  mobility of financial capital.   Governments must compete for  investment. 
> 
>Two considerations combine to make radical change near impossible: 
> 
>First,  because of the nature of corporate ownership, you cannot trace who  exactly these elites/rich even are, and moreover they conduct their  activities behind the veil of the corporation, often hiring entire  sectors of the population - lawyers, judges, accountants, CEOs,  politicians to contribute in this exploitative and destructive system.   Thus you have no clear enemy except your fellow citizens.  In fact I  would argue that entire cities, in particular financial centres (e.g.  London) have most of the population engaged in what Marx would call  'unproductive labour', labour that only exists in order to maintain the  capitalism system.  That is why many people find their jobs  'meaningless' - because it is, everyone (who have not been sufficiently  brainwashed by education) understands this. 
> 
>Secondly,  people say the political system is rigged, which is partly true - but  it is worse than that.  Its the general population themselves which are  the problem, who are purposefully kept ignorant.  You can't blame them,  they were born to lower class surroundings, work all day, and have had  little chance to educate themselves.  They are really stuck and thus are  easily swayed by demagogues - simply consider Trump and others.  Even  if the 'right' politicians are elected, that does not significantly  change the structure of power for what matters is the ownership of  resources (property) which in the majority of countries is guaranteed by  private property rights and cannot be undone except for a revolution.    As stated above, governments in the face of global finance still has  limited power. 
> 
>My points above  actually combine.  That is to say, a revolution necessary to overthrow  capitalism would lead many jobs and thus privileged livelihoods of  middle to upper-class people to be put at risk or lost.  Given that  people don't really care about others outside their immediate family and  social groups, they won't be willing to risk any change.  Moreover on  an international scale the same logic applies.  The fact is the West  benefits greatly from capitalism (although this is definitely changing),  and will not want to change the current state of affairs.  Look at so  many countries facing immigration problems and how people react -  communities are quite willing to maintain their higher standard of  living if it means others suffer.  So in reality, a revolution that is  required is not a fight against a small handful of people - it means  asking tens of millions (or far more), to give up their privilege in  society, and it is precisely these tens of millions who have much of the  power and property, which still pales in comparison to the few hundred  elites/mega rich.

>Saying all this,  there is a real possibility that even if humanity radically shifts the  way our economy functions, we will not have the time necessary to combat  climate change, which will spiral out of control.

https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/As-World-Burns-Cuba-Number-1-For-Sustainable-Development-WWF-20161027-0018.html

""Sustainable development"" = Low energy use, low waste production, high HDI (human development index including factors like life expectancy, mortality, health), etc.

Cuba has ~3.5 metric tons of CO2 emissions per capita annually compared to the US' ~16.5 (16.5 -> 3.5 is a 79% reduction in GHG emissions, almost identical to the figure the scientific consensus advocates)

In other words, we have...ONE country on planet Earth with a model that even remotely resembles what we need to achieve in order to become ""sustainable.""

Meanwhile, we are rushing headlong into food and water shortages by 2030.

We put 35 billion tons of carbon in the air per year, and it will take decades for CCS to sequester even 1 billion of those tons per year, with no guarantee of success.

212;"Ken Loach made a film about England's social program. Himself not a young man, he made ""I, Daniel Blake"", which tells the tale of a 59-yrs-old guy with a heart problem trying to get disability, and a single mother (with 2 children from 2 fathers) he tries to help.

Curiously, when I became aware of that film, I remembered reading a passage from ""The Coming Dark Age"" of Marc Widdowson, a forgotten classic. In his book he mentioned Herman Melville seeing an unmarried mother starving to death, with no one caring about it.

I did more research on this, and that incident occurred in 1839 when Melville was 19 and working as a shipbuilder in that English city.

Here is a passage in his autobiographical novel ""Redburn"".

https://inspidered.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/redburn-and-liverpool-of-the-mid-nineteenth-century/

Tl.dr: While walking around the poorer district of Liverpool, 19 yrs old Melville sees a woman wailing in street, with two starving infants in arms. He had pity on her, but the locals are not interested upon caring her , and say she deserves the fate.

Melville, being a naive American, tries to help her as best as he could but the next day she and her children were 'cleaned up'.

Such was how civilization worked. Melville, never a guy with much success in life, despaired about human condition and later wrote Bartleby, showing there is no hope in humanity (and whose last scene resembles the above incidence, which must have a lasting mark in him).

========

I cited the irish famine and the bengal famine of 1943 a few times. Such was how civilized countries coped with famine.

I also raised the example of Japan in 1945, when 100 million people (not all of them ethnic Japanese) prepared to die to preserve the Imperial institution.

As resource dwindle, social programs will be hurt and taxpayers will be very, very reluctant to support more social program.

As the balance of power decisively shifts in favor of the taxpayers, a lot of the poor will fall outside of the safety net, literally to deaths like Mortal Kombat dungeons.

As alt-right and social darwinism become the mainstream worldview, it will be ok to let people starve to death, or kill those begging for food. In fact in fancy locals it will be encouraged, to keep uncomely people away from the street like the beautiful streets of Sao Paolo.

I personally see no point of feeding people who won't contribute anything to society, but my views are held as demonic now. But apparently even the poorer townspeople , probably illiterate, of Liverpool knew there were lives not worth saving and they should die. (And that was 2 decades before Darwin published the Origin of Species.)

213;"A few thoughts:

* Some have said it is nothing more than a laundry list of worst case scenario consequences. There's a section of that, but that maybe takes up only half or less of the book, I think. The best parts of the book are his discussion of cultural narratives we already have that either unconsciously speak to our anxiety or create barriers against reality. (He discusses how Silicon Valley ideology can only imagine itself as the greatest threat to existence through A.I.)
* As a long-time collapse follower, I would say that there is not much you haven't heard--but it is comprehensive. It includes discussion of Guy McPherson, Dark Mountain Project, potential feedback loops, etc., for example.
* I was surprised that the majority of the worst case material was not things that will happen, but things that are currently happening or happened in just the last 5 years or so. In that way, the book is not that speculative and shouldn't be dismissed as mere speculation. I actually forgot about many of the global disasters of late--or forgot that they happened so close together.
* Clearly, Wallace-Wells is as thoroughly read-up on this topic as anyone I know. Refreshingly, he doesn't pick a solution to fix the problem. He says at the end that he agrees it will require a WWII level global mobilization--but wonders if our current global society is even capable of doing such a thing. Basically, 2 is guaranteed at this point but 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 degrees may not be.
* He isn't hopeful in the sense that he thinks we can fix this problem easily or even fix it at all. But he does still think we have a choice between putting on the breaks or accelerating into the disaster. The uncertainty in climate futures has a lot to do with human action. Somehow we admit we are powerful enough to change the climate inadvertently, and yet deny that we are powerful enough to do anything about its consequences. We are gods who, in awe of our own powers, consider ourselves impotent. When we retreat, we abdicate responsibility and action at the very moment in which our actions have the greatest impact on the world and the future. That's my crib. To be honest, I find it somewhat compelling.
* I will probably read this book again. Maybe in a few months or a year. I will probably give copies to a few choice friends. It is a well-written summary of what I think is going on. I think it's an important book.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Community Response: Literature Reccomendation;Climate Change & Global Warming: General;Systemic Inequality & Systemic Critique;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

217;"I'd be interested in people's predictions about which way it will play out. It isn't a binary thing, more a sliding scale. Collapse is a certainty: our civilisation is thoroughly unsustainable and fundamentally unfixable. I am not particularly interested whether the final destination is stabilisation at a sub-one-billion population or human extinction, but how it happens and how long it takes.

Fast collapse means some big event takes us out. This would happen if Yellowstone went off, or there was a major nuclear exchange, but could also be, say, some sort of critical technological breakdown which sets off a chain reaction of other problems. Maybe the total collapse of democracy, and the rise of a dystopian totalitarianism which makes everything worse.

Slow collapse means most people just get slowly boiled like a pot of frogs. Living standards and life expectancy steadily fall, life opportunities (decent jobs, affordable housing, routes out of poverty) get more and more elusive, number of homeless and people using foodbanks keeps increasing, suicides increasing, etc...  But the powers that be manage to keep western civilisation going, by bending the rules, etc....

As for me...I'm much closer to the slow collapse than the fast one. There will be lurches on the way down, as specific bits of the system break down. Eventually the internet will become unreliable, and the comms satellites could suffer a cascade failure. But for most people, things will just slowly keep getting shitter and shitter, while they argue with each other about what is really causing it and what should be done.

Drone tech is advancing swiftly and could easily be applied to this.


If we build a few thousand individual solar panels with some thrusters and put them in n array at the L1 point between Earth and the sun.

The neoliberal capitalists know the economy has to shift dramatically to allow corporations to automate and transfer as much workload to artificial intelligence as possible. To do this swiftly they have come up with a plan.

Hillary intentionally ran the worst Presidential campaign in history and Trump dances into the White House.

Trump immediately starts gutting regulations across the board and putting industry executives into positions to help increase corporate profits.

CorporatIons and the wealthy then receive a massive tax break and buy stocks at a rapid pace.

These actions have pushed the stock market to unprecedented heights.

Legal price gouging for 100 year old life saving medication like insulin ensures stock prices soar while the people get angry.

The media turns on Trump the minute he's sworn in and the GOP makes blunder after blunder driving voters away.

Massive investigations will prove Trump has broken multiple tax laws right around election time.

The far left liberal socialist democrats take Washington by storm vowing to reign in corporate corruption.

Investors know the market is about to lose value due to impending regulations.

The smart ones sell fast and soon the mass panic sets in.

The DOW plunges below 10,000 in a month and the second great depression begins.

Companies automate and go AI as fast as possible and jobs are lost by the millions.

The depression drags on and Fox News is screaming about the obvious failures of socialism.

A new shiny republican emerges promising to make America great again.

Once elected the money hidden in offshore bank accounts by the wealthy and corporatIons will come flooding back to purchase America for a song.

The new Republican saviour appoints in his/her wealthy friends who have spent the last four decades buying up vast tracts of Canadian tundra for virtually nothing.

Tundra that is now unfrozen due intentionally made global warming.

The largest untapped landmasses have been permanently frozen across Siberia and Canada.

The new gold rush is on to develop the temperate new land while keeping the equatorial countries locked in a burning cage.

Canada is logged, mined and turned into the New North America while Russia and China develop Siberia. This starts a new economic cold war.

A China, Russia, India and Africa alliance will form uniting billions under one currency. The Middle East and Europe quickly join after the initial announcement.

New North America will scramble to ""save the south"" after heat, famine and disease have killed 50% of Latin and South America.

So much new land to develop so much money to be made...

Now that the United American Nation has been created all the suppressed medical treatments and advanced military propulsion technology will be patented by various mega corporations to ensure technological domination.

The entire American continent is quickly turned into a world class medical treatment resort with legal gambling, prostitution, drugs and one hell of a tax haven.

Another inquiry I have is that I??e heard of stock buybacks but I?? not sure I have a good grasp at how this works or how wide this activity is practiced. Is the federal government really printing money and giving it to banks? Then the banks give the money to big corps, then the corps buy stocks in their own company? If this chain of events is correct, how long can that go on? Does this mean big corps are not spending that money on investing in growing the business?

My final topic of thought while we are at it is this. If the federal reserve is printing lots of money, why doesn?? it cost me a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy some ramen noodles? Isn?? cash printing supposed to devalue a currency?

Especially because some of these got filtered out by reddit and didn't post properly/publicly (like the Christmas special double bill, grrr!) so I'm not sure anyone saw them first time around.

But the mods are helpful, and future posts shouldn't be sidelined into the shadows (fingers crossed.)

Suggestions for future screenings always gratefully received, and I always love your feedback in comments and messages.

I'm kinda busy sorting out my doomstead plans in RL (and there is a shitload to be done! lol,) so there probably won't be many non-film club posts from me for awhile.

But I will keep up with posting film club links since they seem quite popular :)

As ever, every post has a link to the full movie, streamed online. Sorry about the assorted popup ads etc. (I know how annoying some of these sites are,) - that's beyond my control. I don't upload or host them - I just find 'em, write 'em up and post the link.

Possibly some of the viewing links have expired/moved over the last 6 months (the net's like that y'know - shit changes fast!) You'll have to use Google to find new ones if you're desperate (""watch xxx online free"" is all the search formatting you'll likely need ;)

So the US Department of Defence has managed to lose $21 Trillion mostly in black budgets.

The thing is if the US economy can afford to lose this amount of money and still function then surely it's a long way from the imminent collapse that we keep hearing about on this forum.

Also if the US could recover this money or prevent further losses then other aspects of collapse could be massively offset by recovering some of the $21 trillion or even preventing further losses.

Are you aware of this and how do you think this affects or could affect collapse?

Or could this $21 trillion be what is keeping the US economy from collapsing?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Macroeconomics & Systemic Risk;?;?;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
229;"As promised, I will counter Gail Tverberg's point. Although she graciously allowed me back to her blog, for which I am thankful, I will continue to stay here.

--

1. Many economies have collapsed in the past. the world economy is very close to the turning point where collapse starts in earnest

--

I have rebutted Turchin and Tainter a few times so repeating them is not needed.

She said as resources per capita start falling, overheads continued to grow (her example - need to pay high-level officials and to fund armies)  and earnings of workers fell, which led to collapse.

Well, tech advances have eliminated the need for many high-level officials, and armies are now being mechanized and digitalized, with hardly any need for flesh-and-blood soldiers, which could be paid very little if necessary.

armies grow when economies are tough, and the need to pay high wages to soldiers disappear.

And, most people in 1910 lived with wages barely paying for their tenements and stale bread. Not fun, but still much better than what their granddads managed.

--
she cited more examples of overheads, such as retiree payments, and payment of debt with interest. The former could be curtailed, and the latter could be extended forever for the big boys. Since nobody is going to call the loan against USA, USA can get away lending to the big boys as long as it feels like.

---

2. Peak of world coal consumption occurred in 2014, and China and India, whose economic growths are dependent upon coal, will grow much slower and face more financial troubles.

--

India's coal is of bad quality and not fit for industrial power-generation. It was already importing coal for that purpose.

Coal consumption is falling because better ways not using coals are being developed.

[3] If we assume that coal supplies will continue to shrink, and other production will grow moderately, we can expect total energy consumption to be approximately flat in 2017.

So? We might be using energy more efficiently, so more consumption may not be needed.

[4] Because world population is rising, the forecast in Figure 4 suggests that per capita energy consumption is likely to shrink. Shrinking energy consumption per capita puts the world (or individual countries in the world) at the risk of recession.

Yes, some individual countries in the world will be put into 'recession'. Precisely the countries which can ill afford the higher-price energy resources. Big deal.

It's like there is a famine, and the poorest families can't afford food and starve, but the restaurants are open and parties are being held in the burgher's house. Nothing to worry.

She does point out the devices getting more efficient, and such is the case to counter with higher oil prices earlier which could return.

>If consumers become less wealthy, they are likely to replace devices less frequently, leading to slower growth in efficiency.

More likely, they will do without. If it is not a life-or-death device , like heaters in cold climate, they will not use it. Problem solved.

And, to save heat bills, they will choose to get devices which will save energy when they can since that's cheaper.

[5] Because many countries are in this precarious position of falling resources per capita, we should expect to see a rise in protectionism, and the addition of new tariffs.

Protectionism will only make things worse since it raises inferior domestic products' price even higher.

Wages will be suppressed so cheaper goods could arrive. Bad news for those who don't make much, not that bad for those who already have a lot.

[6] China can no longer be expected to pull the world economy forward.

True, but America will do so. Thru its robust stock and other financial markets which will be lending to investors at lower rates.

I have quoted a lot of the grey enlightenment guy's links showing America is not doing badly so I won't do it again.

--
[7] While Item [2] talked about peak coal, there is a very significant chance that we will be hitting peak oil and peak natural gas in 2017 or 2018, as well. 

Again, as everyone knows, it is 'cheaper' oil which is peaking. As the price of oil moves beyond what ordinary people could afford, a new equilibrium will take place at , say , $300/barrel. Sure, there will be lots of 'adjustments', but it does not make the world economy come apart. Too much is bet upon continuing the system, none of the world's elites are willing to 'rock the boat'.

We are simply going back to the pre-1914 economy, that's all, a world where it was much less polluting, much less disturbence, etc.

[8] Unless oil prices rise very substantially, oil exporters will find themselves exhausting their financial reserves in a very short time (perhaps a year or two). Unfortunately, oil importers cannot withstand higher prices, without going into recession

Which has to do with the financialization of everything. The truth is, oil exporters, and oil importers possibly, will be bailed out as long as it is needed, since money can be created by the pushing of a few buttons.

The world saw 'helicopter money' bailing out the bad investment banks, but if Henry Paulson & co had let them go, and jailed the bankers, the world would have entered a deeper depression.

To save the world's stability, these people will be bailed out, something dolph in Gail's blog has pointed out more than once.

9] US interest rates are likely to rise in the next year or two, whether or not this result is intended by the Federal reserve.

That can't be ruled out, but Ms. Yellen's  term will not end till early 2018, which means no major interest hike till next year (which is already beyond the scope of 2017 which she had put as a premise). And, since Mr. Trump is aware enough of Goldman Sachs' power to put a former GS employee as the Treasury secretary, I don't think he will rock the boat too much.

Again, the key is bifurcation. The world is coming apart between the world of 'haves' and the rest. And, since most of the world's economic activities occur in the realm of the 'haves', whatever going in the rest does not really matter, so they could be allowed to collapse as long as their departures do not hurt the 'core'.

It might be bad news to the hinterlands and the corners of world no one really wants to see, but the world economy won't come apart in 2017, which is the chief point I wanted to counter.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Macroeconomics & Systemic Risk;Resource Depletion & Energy;Agriculture & Food Systems;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

>    The Corn Laws were enacted in 1815 to keep continental grain out of the [islands of Great Britain and Ireland]. By cutting off England from the continent, the Napoleonic Wars had turned Ireland into a breadbasket for the rapidly growing English cities. The Corn Laws ??passed primarily to aid English farmers ??maintained the Irish competitive edge and encouraged Irish landlords to commit their fields to wheat for export. By the 1840??, 75% of Irish arable land was devoted to cash crops for England.

>    Over the same period, the Irish population grew at a rate much faster than that of England or of Europe generally. In 1750, the population of Ireland was about 3 million. In 1840, it was about 8 million ??the highest it has ever been. They were almost entirely rural poor, and because Ireland was not industrializing, there was no work for them. Being Catholics, they had few legal rights.

 >   There was no work for these new millions. Instead, they lived in ??abins??almost outside the money economy, on scraps of waste land rented from landlords under the conacre system ??annual rental without the legal rights or social expectations of tenancy. They paid rent in kind or in labor. Many of them lived far from towns and manor houses, in distant villages in the south and southwest, isolated from the organized middle class and aristocratic life of the country. They lived on potatoes and cabbages, with the occasional cup of buttermilk or bit of bacon.

>    Wheat is grown in large fields, requires animals and teams of manpower for seeding, plowing and harvest, is stored in covered buildings safe from water and rats, and must be ground into flour by a miller. All these things require an organized society in which the various participants, both rural and townsfolk, are linked by economic necessity. If the system of growing and distributing wheat is disrupted, many people at all levels of society suffer.

>    By contrast, potatoes were grown in unplowed ??azy beds,??hand tilled and harvested, left in the ground until wanted for food, and dug up and eaten without processing. A family could raise potatoes and cabbages for a generation, and trade them for the occasional tool or piece of cloth, without ever entering into any money transactions or forming any long-term economic ties with anyone. They did not deal with people outside their small communities. They were mostly illiterate, and most spoke no English. They had large families, each generation crowding onto the patches of waste land they could afford from their landlords.

>    When the potato blight hit their crops, these people were utterly defenseless. They had no legal rights to speak of; no rights to their lands; no money savings; no skills; no relationships with anyone in a position to help them. No one needed their labor; no one outside their communities knew them personally. The landlords were happy to see them go, as they could then improve the land for the ever more profitable wheat, cattle, and sheep.

>    As hundreds of thousands swarmed onto the paths and roads, looking first for work, then for food, and then for a place to lie down and die, they appeared completely alien and even frightening to the townsfolk and the landowners ??different in speech, religion, customs, and physical appearance, like foreign intruders in their own country. Many hundreds of thousands more never left their villages, dying out of sight in their hovels and under their hedges.

>    It was a famine that didn?? matter to anyone who had the power to stop it. If anything, the deaths of two million and the emigration of a million more was a positive benefit to the English and to the Anglo-Irish who ruled the country.

and,

>Shay Begorrah 12.17.12 at 1:44 pm

>    While the ??enocide??label for the great famine seems excessive (it was more ??ut the brutes on a diet??than exterminate them) the unpleasant demographic problem of Catholic Ireland was neatly and fortuitously dealt with, and partially thanks to the merits of the free market. Today the population of the UK excluding Northern Ireland is about ten times that of the island of Ireland, in 1841 it was only twice the population of its troublesome western neighbour.

>    To be more exact in 1841 the population of England, Scotland and Wales came to about 18.5 million while Ireland?? was 8.1 million. An annoyingly large proportion of these 8.1 million were not just illiterate savages but illiterate Catholic savages of questionable loyalty. The famine led to an astonishingly long period of population shrinkage in Ireland as these ne??r believe wells first died and then emigrated. In fact Ireland?? population only stopped decreasing in around 1967, 115 years after the end of the famine.

>    Quite an advertisement for the benefits of laissez faire and the policy prescriptions of The Economist.


Tl.dr: in the standpoint of civilization, and in a Benthamian Utilitarian perspective, the famine was good since it lifted a large burden from Britain, cleared more land for the more successful, and eliminated a large potential threat of uneducated and potentially disloyal population.
==

People like Gail Tverberg think that a reduction of population can't be sustained, and it will bring down Civilization with it.

Wrong.

Right now, 89% of the world's wealth is held by the more advanced nations including China's four wealthiest coastal provinces (which hold more than half of all of China's wealth), and the rest of world, numbering perhaps 6 billion, own the remaining 11%.

In other words, even if the rest of the world disappears tomorrow, it will only hurt about 11% of the world economy.

A dieoff will affect the weaker, the less informed, the less skilled first. The stronger, the better informed, and the more skilled will still have some kind of place.

The powers that be have no reason to stop the dieoff when it means there will be less troublemakers and less complexities.

It is the dieoff of more capable members of civilization, like the Cambodian genocide of more intelligent people, which hurt Civilization.

The billions will die out of sight, out of mind of the people who do matter. And their few properties will be claimed by those who are stronger, and economic growth will occur from it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Macroeconomics & Systemic Risk;Agriculture & Food Systems;?;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To this end, I'm currently adding everyone who's ever posted a thread in /r/collapse to the Approved Submitters list. This is thankfully automated, but it'll take a while.

Mod's Log, stardate 2019.125; I have decided to start a regular journal for transmission to Home Base, in order to keep the folks back home appraised of our perilous adventures aboard the Century-class ship Collapse.

We encountered a wild Cretin who decided to broadcast our presence in the sector to the Millenium-class ship Worldnews. This resulted in some undue and unexpected growth of our ship's hull, counter to our goals of fostering an intelligent and functional exploratory crew. The growth attack prompted us to experiment with some of the tools available in the Moderation Toolbox computer routine; although many of those aboard this vessel won't receive this encoded transmission, I feel it necessary to apologise for their inconvenience during the enacting of those temporary measures.

Further experimentation with the Toolbox has been slated for some time in the future, though a fixed schedule is not forthcoming from Engineering at this time.

Throughout the last Timespan, we've noted an increasing number of submission titles on the lower decks of the ship which have been editorialised to the point of losing all meaning, such as ""2 in a row"". Because these titles are entirely unhelpful to the ship's mission, we are currently disseminating advice regarding submission titles: they should contain information about the submission, else they are liable for removal by the janitorial crew.

We've also encountered a number of posts from the midsection of the ship, that cannot be verified as having originated from human crew members. This is because they are video or audio posts with no submission statement, so it can't be proven that the subject matter has been looked over for relevance to our mission; as such, we're stepping up the interval of our removal routines for video and audio posts that have no accompanying statement of relevance. It should be noted that our standing rule 2 allows for the posting of obscure material as long as a statement of relevance is forthcoming at the time of submission, so we are currently disseminating that information through the midsection and lower decks.

We continue our travels through the sector, and expect to report again somewhere around stardate 2019.160.

239;"For a while it has been argued that the human traits that drive us towards collapse, i.e greed, expansion, growth, are our natural drivers, so our collapse would have been inevitable anyway ever since we discovered fossil fuels.

Another factor is arguably driving us towards collapse - stupidity. But is this a natural inevitable phenomenon as well?

Does evolution prefer stupidity? I mean people, who don't ask questions, but just work hard and try to handle all obstacles thrown at them, and try to survive as long as possible, would stand a better chance of surviving. If you start asking too many critical questions, you might realize that everything is pointless and you would be more prone to throwing in the towel. But that wouldn't be good from evolutionary survival point of view, which demands attempts to survive at all costs without doubts (*and this includes war, stealing, etc*).

There seems to be one thing that most people seem to agree on - that humans by and large are stupid. (lol, the irony)

Politicians bitch and fight,

An elephant in the room.

War to live another night.

With Bolsonaro,

The forests were cut.

Taken for granted, sold the soil.

Broken our promise to god above.

Deserts replace the grass we loved.

And it?? all over now.

Too late to change the outcome somehow now.

This is how we sold the soil.

&#x200B;

Thunder followed with a storm,

The rain come thudding down.

Flood the streets and wreck the cars,

That caused the sky to cry out.

Menace reaps the harvest sown,

And the race is all but worn down;

Many lives just carry on,

All the same, intellectuals riddled with doubt.

Who?? to claim we screwed it up?

Nobody takes the bout of shame.

The Earth warmed up,

The White House joked,

Refused the facts of what?? to come.

the mess that they'll have to fix.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Community Response: Literature Reccomendation;?;?;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

* If I understood half the things I hear, I would be a very smart man.

Collapse cannot be fixed because it is cumulative, unstoppable and irreversible.

**Total World Energy = 10% of Warming**

Global warming is the extra heat earth gets from the sun due to GHGs.

The chances of any particular year being one of the hottest 10 on record is about 1 in 10.

The chances of 35 years in a row being the hottest are 1 in a billion, billion, billion.

Global warming is only 1/1,000??? of the total solar energy hitting earth.

Total world energy use is only 1/10?????of the extra energy earth gets from??global warming.

**Source:** [Thunderf00t on YT](https://youtu.be/N5UugtV06qw) \- 9:11 minutes

Global electricity use is 23% of Total World Energy use.

So 100% solar and wind powered electricity will only affect like 3% of global warming.

But only if you have 100% fully operational power working 100% of the time.

Large offshore wind turbines will cost twice as much and last half as long as expected.

100% solar wind global electricity is impossible, and even if not, it will have zero effect on runaway hothouse mass extinction, other than minor varies to speed.

Speed matters because life on earth is going extinct even without global warming.

We are poisoning everything from bug to fish to bird to frog.

CO??gas will cumulatively, irreversibly and unceasingly heat earth every day forward.

Indoor urban air with 1,000 ppb CO??makes you 15% stupider.

Fossil combustion causes magnetic nano particle build up in the brain.

Nano plastic metals are eating the blood walls to your brain from inside your head.

Green house gases must go down, or life on earth will die even faster than we poison it.

It took 100 years for total CO??levels to go up 30%.

But human GHG emissions went up [50% in just 30 years](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

Up from 23 to 36 billion tons per year.

Human emissions went up at least 40% since COP25 started 25 years ago.

[We failed at 4 international climate agreements in 30 years](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/canada-emissions-record.jpg?w=768).

If 30 years of failure is not proof enough of collapse for you, then nothing will be.??

You're okay Boomer. It's all right Zoomer.

Global warming will trip 5 Major Tipping Points between 1.5?? and 2 ??C triggering runaway hothouse mass extinction.

Runaway hothouse mass extinction cannot be reversed or stopped, accumulates and accelerates forward through time.

Breaching multiple major systemic tipping points causes runaway conditions.

Plus we lost half the animals on earth in 40 years, and we'll lose half again in 20.

All the vertebrate and insect mass on earth are being wiped out by crop and livestock poison.

Bird fish and frogs are dying from our food, water and soil, not just weeds and bugs.

Vertebrate and insect brain and male sex organs are degraded by petrochemicals.

All sexes of vertebrates and insects are more sterile, weaker, sicker and stupider due to petrochemical degradation.??

This in not yet obvious but is cumulative, and cannot be stopped or reversed without exposure reduction.

These petrochemical nano micro particles are in 98% of us.

The metals, plastics and pharmaceuticals in our water food and clothes is lethal.

The chemicals in our SuperFund toxic waste sites will be released by climate fire and flood.

The Canadians have to freeze enough arsenic dust to kill all humanity in the melting arctic tundra forever, and always without fail.

America's aging nuclear plants threaten catastrophe.??

So why don't we just plant a lot of trees???

To get the U.S. to carbon neutral you would have to plant 20 million trees twice per day, but only if they can grow full height in a single day

**ZERO carbon USA prescription** = 2,000,000 full grown new trees, 2 X per day before bed

Forests are dying [now](https://csfs.colostate.edu/2017/02/15/800-million-standing-dead-trees-colorado/), planting trees won't [fix ](https://mashable.com/article/california-tree-die-off-climate-change/)it.

The tropical trees we do plant are for timber, rubber and palm oil plantations, and are counted as rain forests paid by green carbon tax credits.

Up to 50% of the renewable electricity Nordic Europe gets comes from burning imported tree pellets.

This massive fraud is subsidized by carbon taxes.

Only rich people can afford the carbon taxes we all pay.

If everybody pays carbon taxes, the rich can afford them.

They call it social justice. James Hansen knows how to fix this but no one gives a fuck.

We have forgotten how to fix and do things right.

We can't even rebuild the moon rockets the way they were made with slide rulers.

The skill sets we need to survive are not finding tax havens for governments, NGOs and corporations.

Governments, NGOs and corporations have nothing to do with our survival.

They only think they do because of all that privileged schooling.

Once we get that through our head, we'll be better off.

The endless war of bread and roses must stop.

242;"Solar radiation sickness affects both plants and animals.

At 62, I've given up sun tanning, I know the sun burns more.

China was caught trying to smuggle illegal ozone destroying chemicals into Europe.

Contrary to MSM reports, the ozone layer has never stopped depleting between 60?? N and 60?? S, in the lower part of the upper atmosphere, where the vast majority of ozone resides. Most people live between those 2 latitudes.

UV radiation always gets stronger the closer you get to the equator, and more people live there.

The earth's magnetic field is weakening extremely fast and affects South America and southern Africa most.

A weakening magnetic field lets in more UV radiation, which combined with lower ozone protection, means people can expect increased solar radiation sickness, but especially in South America and southern Africa. Sun tan lotion makes corals sick.

Air Conditioning demand is skyrocketing due to longer, more intense heat blocks.

By 2050, air conditioning is expected to use up all available renewable energy production.

This AC gold rush will result in more chemical smuggling and more ozone destruction.

The rush of human urbanization is biggest in China, who pour more cement in 3 years than America ever had. They pave enough roads to cover America 2X each year. They have mega projects coming out the ying yang.

The LA SanFran rail project has been pushed to 2033. World emissions must be down 50% by that time.

The gold rush for condos worldwide will result in construction fraud and unsafe buildings. Safe construction sand is running out. Construction fraud is the new normal.

244;"I usually have to take a break from this sub once a month.  It lasts a week or so.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  It's hard not to get angry/upset/despairing.  In the face of such helplessness, what do we do???  Certainly there are personal measures you can take to minimize what's coming, but that's small comfort.  Forgetting about our individual selves, the sadness of what we are doing to the exquisite creatures of this planet is overwhelming sometimes.

&#x200B;

But I have something (possibly small, possibly not-small) to offer when you are feeling this way. Once or twice a day sit quietly.  Twenty minutes each time will do it, but more is great too.  As thoughts come into your mind, don't grab onto them and start spinning narratives around them, just let them go their merry way down the stream.  BUT ALSO, don't shove them away.  That doesn't work.  Your thoughts will not respond to being pushed off.  Keep in the back of your mind that you are NOT your thoughts/opinions/ideas.  You experience those things (thoughts I mean) but you are much larger than those things.  MUCH.  And this is an attempt to have the experience of who you truly are WITHOUT all those thoughts and opinions and information.

&#x200B;

One last part of this process which is important:  chose a word, any word that you are fond of, but nothing too specific (like Maryann).  A word like ""peace"" or ""blue"" or ""tree"" or whatever.  This word will greatly assist you when you start to get carried away by a thought.  So a thought starts to sink its teeth into you and you come back your chosen word to help you let it go.  Always come back to the word.

&#x200B;

Practice this for a while and see what happens.  You may be surprised.  (Or not.)  I feel sure if you stick to it, it will help you cope with the terribleness that is coming down the pike.

Interestingly - the unit can act as a ""telepresence"" robot, where someone can wear VR goggles, which show an image of what the two cameras in its head are showing, and move its arms remotely too. Bomb defusing when the bomb can't just be blown up (as is usual)?

There's also a display of software not often seen in video of AI robotic tests - a fully virtual world with a fully virtual robot that is getting controlled by the robot AI.           
This is cool for so many reasons - neural networks can be trained in the simulated physical world, without needing people to keep manipulating the robot, and it getting damaged as it learns new skills.        

It also means complex scenarios in a military environment can be simulated - cars driving around, soldiers hiding behind buildings, tanks on the horizon...... many running at once without needing large amounts of land to run them on.

248;"If we don't cut emissions by 2020 we're fucked, they say, which is great because that means nothing is going to happen until the next election.

But, there is something we can do immediately, the low-hanging fruit of climate change, the easy-to-do thing, which is to cut short-lived greenhouse gases. Those gases are from fracking, air-conditioners and soot. They are methane, hydro-fluoro-carbons and black carbon dots. We will not see a reduction before the next presidential election. We risk doing nothing for 5 years. Very glib people want to control the future carbon taxes you'll be paying.

Germany scaled back climate targets undercover of the release of the Special Climate Report. They use carbon credits to burn trees and ignore the emissions, it's no wonder Americans don't want it. These are the same diesel car liars who burn palm oil to drive around and fake car emission tests. We don't want that fake green shit here.

Michael She-Mann admitted on Real News that the special climate report was watered down. I call him that because he's with her. He wants government control of carbon taxes, which should be 100% private. When pressed about Gov. Brown's fracking record, She-Mann deflected. He thinks Celestial Jerry Brown is the Messiah.

There have been 30 years of climate predictions by the UN that  over-estimated the near-term danger of climate change, ie: they predicted the Maldives would be underwater by now. There's a guy on YouTube who shills that's proof climate change is not real. Climate science was a baby 30 years ago. It still is.

Permafrost wetland emissions will smash the carbon budget you see in all the pretty climate charts. They're all outdated, history, toast. West Antarctica is already runaway and sits on a woke volcano. Carbon banks are turning into carbon bombs.

We are beyond stopping climate change, but we can still mitigate it if people would just stop arguing about carbon taxes and make them 100% private like James Hansen says.

Climate change is a line that curves up and then goes straight down. Shaming people into paying you carbon taxes is not going to work in America. The only way people will pay more taxes is if it's 100% private.

249;"Hi,

&#x200B;

Long-time lurker, but this is a new account because of the horrible things I'm being forced to say. I suspect like many other people's posts similar to this one, this is mostly just a way of getting my thoughts in order and to see them written out in front of me.

I've got my fingers crossed, obviously, that the planet isn't heading for that dreaded hothouse scenario, and I'm praying to a god that I don't believe in that the ravages of climate change will stop short of actually depriving us of a breathable atmosphere. I accept that over the next hundred years, and probably starting well within the next decade, hundreds of millions of us, if not billions, are going to die, but naturally I won't be one of them, because I'm the protagonist in the story of my life, and not a supporting player.

My wife and I have two kids, two years old and 8 months, and sometimes I find myself weeping as I smell their hair. I'm fairly sure that despite global food shortages and widespread famine I'll be able to provide for them in spartan luxury as long as things don't get too hopeless, because I'm an eternal optimist. We're in a good place on the planet where the climatic outlook isn't too bleak, we've got a little bit of land, I'm growing vegetables, and I'm into preserving and pickling and fermenting. Right now I'm learning to make cheese, it's pretty rad. We'll be getting chickens, bees, rabbits, a goat.

But I worry that because my part of the planet isn't set to become an arid desert or wind up thirty feet underwater, that countries less fortunate but quite a lot more belligerent will turn their greedy eyes our way in a globe-spanning grab for viable farmland. I worry that, despite my own ability to keep my family alive against the odds (because that is the single biggest hope keeping me going), some future army is going to turf me and my family out of our home and leave us to rot in a starvation camp, along with those other unfortunate hundreds of millions in a similar situation the world over. I have no idea of a timescale for all of this... is this an episode to be aired in five years time? Fifteen? Fifty?

I have to stay optimistic, because this is the only life we get, and we've got to make the most of it. Near-death events in my past have convinced me of that. But I just can't help but find myself landing on the same final scene, no matter what sequence of events my wandering mind describes for the next few decades, be it runaway greenhouse or nuclear winter or total extinction of pollinating insect life or famine-fired World War Three with starvation genocide thrown in for good measure, and that is that one day, I will most likely have to kill my children, and my wife, and my dog, and whatever other animals I'll have at that time, and finally, myself, to prevent us from enduring some other unimaginable suffering.

257;"I think this is the actual fear, all of it is leading up to the Third, and final, world war. That?? fucking terrifying...and it makes no sense, the shitty worthless media channels of the world either ignore this shit or, if you??e an American, *push for war*. All we see is propaganda, always, propaganda against the new enemy. Unlike the Cold War, which so many people think we??e moving towards once again, we no longer live in a world kept ??table??through the alignment of two political blocs, this isn?? a war between a side aligned with the people and the side aligned with democracy or capitalism or whatever, this is more like the days prior to WWI, where no one knows how the alliances will fall, where it?? a competition between nation states rather than ideologies, where the current global hegemon/empire is now declining just as the British Empire was...

The world...imperialism never ended, ??lobalism??is really just a nice way of saying ??lobal imperialism?? or rather the entire division of the world between imperialist states. We know what the future holds, a world of resource shortage, famine, dehydration, and of course, war, war, war. Well...that day has already arrived, these tariffs didn?? come about solely because of Trump or anything, the EU was engaging in some tariffs and economic stops already, every year we overshoot our global resource budget, *the world has already run out*. Starvation, dehydration, they caused the Arab Spring and the refugee crisis just as much as the actions of the US Empire did.

When I say World War 3 is coming, I don?? mean as in its coming in the 2070s or something when climate change is actively devastating much of the world, climate change is *already doing this*; what I mean is that it?? coming *soon*. The world has seemingly walked onto a path, a path that can only end in the largest war in human history, the rate of profit has fallen and will continue to fall, capitalism is soon to have its greatest economic crisis in history, and the world is completely divided. Just like in 1914 all that?? possible now is a redivision of the world, it?? why countries are starting to stockpile and have begun a new arms race, it?? why they??e scrambling to build alliances. Not only is it like 1914, even more terrifying, just like the 1920s and 30s, fascism has returned as a truly political force in the 1st World, while it existed throughout various dictatorships all throughout the 20th Century, only now has it returned as a force to directly start and wage a world war.

As I said, it?? all already begun, mass surveillance, propaganda, stockpiling, alliance building, concentration camps, increasing border restrictions. This war, if it comes to fruition, it will make World War 2 look like a pleasant dream. If it doesn?? go nuclear almost immediately then just imagine how it will be. Think of the horrifying technologies created since 1945. AI targeting systems, facial scanning tech that can peer through a mask, heat-seeking missiles fired from drones, biological warfare the likes of which has never been seen, genetic engineering, cyber warfare; the Pentagon?? recent paper on WW3 outlines not only the Earth as a battleground, but also space and cyberspace. Imagine that, *space warfare*. All of this technology could have been used to the *betterment* of mankind, to the *betterment* of the Earth, instead it will be used to leave the Earth a wasteland, because that?? what the ruling class and capital demands of us...

Steel yourselves, it??l only get much harder from here, our ancestors faced horrors we couldn?? imagine in the last century, there?? no reason to think our generation wouldn?? have our own battle to fight.

258;I was recently driving, as I was on my way to run an errand, from Loma Linda to Redlands in hopes to take the scenic routes along the way. I've lived in this area my whole life and try to avoid freeways because I know prettier drives to take, even if it takes a few extra minutes. Anyway, I got sick to my stomach seeing once whole open fields being developed for housing. Over the years, since I've been a kid, more and more homes and horribly ugly commercial buildings have been invading my area of Southern California. This time, however, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. There used to be beautiful grasslands and hills I would admire and just hike through, but now it's becoming less a reality and more a fantasy. I just want to tell people who don't venture outside their big city bubbles that California doesnt give a shit about preserving the beauty of our state. Once beautiful nature is being destroyed and no one seems to care. And with droughts and climate change becoming a growing problem, it becomes even more irresponsible and idiotic to keep building new homes in Southern California.

259;"I have been lurking on this sub for a while, and finally decided to post. I just would like to say, that I consider you all, and myself to have an awareness which 99.9999% of the rest of the world doesn't have. Humans are distinctly aware of their own individual mortality, but few are like us, and aware of the broader one. I can't remember when I started thinking about collapse and came on this sub, but it's now something I think about daily.  The threads I have been most interested in are those which concern with the passage of time, from now until some time in the future when business as usual (BAU) no longer exists and what we should do with that time. This post is inspired by the most recent one about saving for retirement.

I would hope in writing this that my own life is similar to some of you out there: single, no children, commute via subway/bus to work, early 30's, good but stressful (at times) career with benefits, and parental and societal pressure to: have kids, buy a house, continue to work in a cubicle, and generally bury my head in the sand and go shopping for groceries on Saturday morning.

I sit at my desk everyday and see the world and city around me falling to pieces, socially, environmentally, economically, etc. I even saw my own personal collapse with my health when at 27 I suffered a major heart attack. But I didn't do anything spectacular, even though I could. I just went back to work. Over the past year I have developed a prepper/minimalist mindset, focused on my physical health, but I have hit a wall in terms of what steps to take next with my life. It's almost as if every choice I make is somehow controlled by the thought of collapse. I see the world in terms of what is really necessary, and what isn't. The new city I want to move to is in FL, hurricanes and red tide. The new job I might want contributes nothing to society. The whole idea of collapse adds a sense of urgency and importance to every decision I make.

I ask myself: what am I doing here at work? Should I just go and travel for a while? I know my time and our time is limited, but I don't know how much so. I really would like to start a business I've been thinking about, but what is the point since it's based on technology?
Every step I could take is inextricably bounded to the future when shtf. So I just stay in the same cubicle, even though I really don't want to, just because of the security it provides.

260;"This headline is tantamount to the view most people have on politics. They see a fight, and it's given a lot of importance by the media, so people think it matters.

It's just a game, being played for our entertainment, given the appearance of being important. One of my favorite quote of all time says it best:

""Politics is just the entertainment branch of the military-industrial complex"" - Frank Zappa

Politics is a game. The fact Trump is president literally doesn't matter. It has some minute effect, sure, but the deep state has been running the show for somewhere between 100 years and 40 years, depending on how you draw the cutoff. The deep state being the military-industrial-banking complex that Eisenhower warned of during his presidential departure speech. The same one that JFK spoke of during his ""Secret societies"" speech, 3 months before he was assassinated.

It's a joooooooke. Nothing in politics should be taken remotely seriously, or treated as if it represents a people. Nations of people are essentially taken hostage by organized assholes, who undergo this rigmarole of ""democracy"" to convince us that we're in control of this thing. We're not. It's a big club and we're not in it. We are not in the club.

There's no question there exist powerful people from all nationalities and corporations trying to gain power over America, as well as gain power over every other damn country in the world. The idea of a nation is simply a boundary where nationalized troops stopped fighting. A war ends when one side runs out of soldiers. Nations are little different than a king's domain, but with the illusion of citizen control. Even the word ""citizen"" itself is a creation of our era, designed around this style of thinking.

Politics is a joke. Politics is kabuki theatre. It's puppets with Jeff Dunham. It's meaningless. It's bullshit. It's garbage. Garbage that is designed to give us the illusion of controlling our destiny, so we can get [screwed by the donkey or screwed by the elephant.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oNfVQ-7M-VQ/THFTY65XDgI/AAAAAAAAAP4/ohnlB1ZUoXo/s1600/march_of_tyranny.jpg) Either way, they get what they want, and the populace gets the illusion of choice. Pepsi vs coke, and I'm over here drinking water. It's not real. It also instills divide and conquer mechanisms by dividing the public in half, who vehemently fight against each other, and deem their half superior to the ""other"" half.

It is time to awaken from our many-thousand-year slumber. It is time to see the hierarchy for what it is. The pecking order is real, but the hen house is the Earth. Let us do away with the misconception that government is by the people, for the people. It is not. We all know it is not, in some moments. Yet we pretend with Hillary vs Trump like it fucking matters which Israel-firster is the one to push the button to bomb Syria. 

This is not a game. This is the real world. This is not a dress rehearsal. This is not an act, or some elaborate troll. This is the truth, and we all see it sitting right in front of us, clear as the nose on our face. But we are afraid to say it. Afraid to even see it. Be afraid no longer.

Here we are, it's 2017. The world is owned by billionaires. How are we going to fix it? How are we going to explain it to others who don't know? What is even the point of this shit? Is this some bad dream?

We must awaken, we must become lucid here in this world, it is the only answer. We must become aware. When we are awake, we say what we believe, and we say it from the heart. Nothing can defeat that, in the long run. Look at the Streisand effect from the execution of Jesus Christ by the Roman state, and the lasting power that has had over 2000 years. What we truly feel, the understanding of the truth we have from our perspectives, this means something. This is real, even if it is not complete.

When we put our hidden feelings in to speech or action, the world changes. And what does the world need now more than change from the path of the status quo? Are we done pretending yet?

Imagine the right side of the line is populism, imagine lighting it like a fuse and watching it burn towards the middle.

The left side of the line is fake liberalism and is made of ideals like food waste recovery and veganism. Idealistic hegemony is the spark that lights the fuse from the left side of collapse.

This political divide is primary driver of collapse.

Rednecks and hippies are actually working together to prevent rational choice, this divide is aided and abetted by politicians and media.

People don't care about collapse, they care about impractical moral victories.

While we're idealistically violent, we only really care about money and love.

We can't do anything about ideals and love, the only thing we can fix is money.

Money scares and lusts us so bad we can't think straight about it.

That's how banksters privatized the nation state's currency and credit over 100 years ago.

The only way to stop imperial fascism is tax carbon and give it 100% back to private citizens.

Do not allow traitors like Bernie Sanders let government take 40% of that money like he wants.

Corporations and governments MUST get ZERO% of carbon dividends, or it will fail being fit for purpose.

You cannot win a war without money.

War = Money

Money can unite us, if it's 100% ours and becomes fit for purpose.

Then people can vote on education and healthcare instead of war as we phase out the imperial deep state.

262;"More often than not, societies don't collapse in singular a monumental event.  It's usually a series of events that can span generations.  If something so significant occurs that tech billionaires scramble to their private jets to be whisked away to their New Zealand bunkers, then we're looking at a global scale event which will likely span the spectrum of resilient communities binding together and all out mayhem in places where basic necessities are unable to be delivered.  Let's not talk about this type of collapse, because it seems rather unlikely and would probably be due to a combination of factors happening at once \(fuel shortage, mass ocean die\-off, global economic crash\).  

What is most likely, is that we are already in the beginning stages of decades\-long collapse.  Certainly the current administration is a symptom to a dying economic model that is based on perpetual wealth being derived from the extraction and commodification of natural resources.  The collapse we are currently staring in the mirror at is a rapidly changing climate, dwindling resources, and a fracturing of societal structure that will most likely cause a series of events that will collapse the industrial economy, and \(hopefully not\) the habitability of large portions of the planet.     

The scenarios I see as most plausible are a mass\-extinction of species as the rate of climate change speeds up in a feedback loop.  Most notably, the oceans will experience large die\-offs in coral life, which supports fish habitat that feeds hundreds of millions of people.  The oceans will further acidify leading to ever expanding dead zones of low oxygen waters.  The coastal food shortages and rising ocean levels will displace hundreds of millions of people, beginning in places like Bangladesh.  The migration of these people will put stresses on countries already having issues assimilating different cultures.  Civil and regional conflicts will likely break out in areas throughout the world as the stresses of mass migrations, food shortages, and other climate related costs take their toll.  Industrial economies around the world would likely begin to collapse under the weight of all the stressors, accelerating and expanding areas of conflict.    

In the United States, violent resentment from the lower class will be sown out of the divisive culture that has been deliberately cultivated by wealthy ruling elites.  Some of this may be directed at the wealthy elite, but more than likely, a wave of violence will be directed towards minorities as blame for collapse will be forced upon those whom blame is currently \(irrationally\) forced upon.  Certain areas of the country may weather the storm of societal collapse.  These regions will have to have sustainable social infrastructure already in place.  There aren't many, or any, of these regions currently in places, but rather pockets of small areas that maybe could serve as a blueprint.  Communities will have to depend upon each other, have systems of barter, be knowledgeable with homesteading, farming, seed saving, etc.  People who think they can live in a bunker off of canned goods, or that somehow they'll just magically unlock the skills to grow their own food with little to zero external inputs are in for a harsh reality.  

The point, I'm trying to make, is if you out there think there may be some form of collapse \(please understand that all civilizations rise and fall\) then go out and take steps to make your communities more resilient.

After 20 years of trying, offshore wind turbines provide 0.3% of world energy, but are they worth it? The closer we get to collapse, the more outlandishly ridiculous headlines will get. This claim is made by the same guy warning us about peak oil by 2011, back in 2007.

* Offshore wind turbines wear out nearly twice as fast as onshore wind turbines. They only last 12 - 15 years compared to 25 years on land. This is because  wind turbine blades actually move much faster (80 km/hr) than they appear to, and offshore ones are pelted by micro-particles, sleet and rain at high speeds. These particles puncture the petrochemical blades with ever growing holes, and their petrochemical finish flakes off into the sea for the little fishies to eat.
* All wind turbines generally produce 90% of the stated power rating only 25% of the time. When you compare how much energy they actually produce compared to their power rating, you find that in their first year of operation, offshore wind turbines produce 25% of their rated power, and in just 15 years, they produce 11% of their rated power. To close a 400 megawatt fossil plant requires 4,000 megawatts of solar/wind power. A 10:1 ratio.
* Not only do the blades literally dissolve into the sea, but the stress factors on newer larger turbines is debilitatingly enormous. They break down faster and more often. Renewable energy takes 1,000 X more space per watt than conventional energy. Offshore wind turbines use 1,000 X more copper than onshore turbines.

Looking at Chinese history, and the US right now, I think the latter would collapse much faster. 

- They are both on the same line of latitude, but the US's agricultural lands are much drier to start with. 
- The Chinese don't hate each other. 
- The Chinese are also not armed to the teeth. 
- They are smaller and thus less susceptible to famine
- Their agricultural style is already well geared towards efficiency, and agricultural skills are more evenly distributed and low tech (as opposed to the US, where 5 guys grow all the food with huge modern tractors)
- China has already collapsed, many times before.  The US never has, and of course the fall will be much harder. 

Population wise, China may lose a greater %age of its population, just because it has so many people already.  But in terms of sheer volume of people, it would still be on top.

---
Yes it is. Always has been. Militarised for 70 years. Killing Russians was more important than a safe environment. All US plants are dying from old age. Too expensive.

There are 400+ nuclear plants on earth, China will build 400 more by 2050. The popular backlash against US nuclear power has sent nuclear expertise to Asia. America's infrastructure is crumbling and nuclear power threatens to contaminate us. It's too big to bail.

Then James Hansen comes out and says we can turn nuclear waste into money because the US can get 300 years clean power out of just our nuclear waste while making it safe.

James Hansen also said that giving the people back 100% of their carbon money will unite the US and be a highly effective way of uniting all humanity towards equality and lower emissions.

This makes James Hansen a social justice issue which I believe supersedes all other considerations.

If all people got 100% of the money paid into energy, the rich would be giving money directly to the poor. This would rejigger our political economy, which is a good thing.

This so scared the political left, that green GMOS refused to endorse the Hansen plan. They poo pooed it. Then Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders passed a bill that said the government is entitled to 40% of that money. The story is always about the money.

James Hansen's plan is a direct threat to the MIC/NGO industries. Greens won't support Hansen's plan, and neither does the military.
 This isn't rocket science, it's true.

India has made particular advances in nuclear science and China is blasting full steam ahead while we sit around with our peckers up our asses talking about pronouns and such. I'm all for that stuff, but com'on, let's get real here folks.

A lot of people think oil was the primary energy source of the 20th century, in fact it was coal. Coal will be going strong for a long time thanks to south Asia, despite what you read in the news. I spent 10 years reading IEA energy reports, and in the last few years their charts have become so obfuscated that deciphering them requires an Enigma Machine.

Out of the 2 billion vehicles on the road by 2030, only 200 million will be electric. Up here in Canada, electric cars suck because you'd freeze your ass off before you get a mile down the road. Nothing drains batteries faster than heating your car in winter. Climate scientists will tell you we have to reduce emissions 100% in 20 years. Economists will tell you we have to reduce them to net zero in 40 years. Net zero is edumuhcated talk for bio-energy and carbon capture. Carbon capture is just a fancy phrase that describes the 2 lines of coke media analysts snort before writing. Bio-energy is just a fancy phrase for burning forests.

(I think this part is enough)

I don't think he is the 'smite' in Gail Tverberg's blog ('smite' said he is in Sweden while this person appears to be a Brit), but his attitude is similar.

Although he might be off-putting to some, he appears to be someone who does not approve BS, and is typical of the futurologists I have seen.

Stumo was older, and the people who mostly engaged him seemed to be older as well, so the conversation went quite politely. However, the 'real' futurologists who completely believe in the stuff uttered by Kurzweill, Musk, etc do not believe in collapse at all so they do not bother with such conversation.

Collapse means the general society collapses. However, for diehard futurologists, even during a collapse if the goals of futurologists (space travel, VR, singularity, etc) are obtained, they win.

They can care less if every species gets extinct and temp rises by 5 celcius, since they are running away into VR now, out of hands of the physical world.

And VR can be fueled by solar power. The newer machines do not consume that much power. Once in cyberspace, it can virtually exist forever.

Only in times dominated by religious moralistic extremism, and even then without the internet a message could only go so far before being distilled, edited, or lost all together.

Now we have Instagram influencers, Youtube stars, podcast celebrities, music gods, facebook preachers, twitter critics, some of which command legions of dedicated fans and subscribers numbering in the tens of millions (hundreds of millions if Pudiepies subscription count is to be believed, unlikely as that is). Perhaps only world leaders or the pope and similar religions icons can claim to have the same reach to the masses, although they have much more power to act upon and change things should they decide to.

These entertainment Messiahs are as influential as entire media corporations with their vast resources and workforce.

And what do they do with this incredible platform we place them on? Well most of the time, they advertise. This is their job, and everything is secondary to the making of money, they are demi-gods of the capitalist system, held up by the loyal consumers and paraded across ten million screens it in order to inspire faith in products and brands. No surprises here of course, we know this.

But at some point, and that point seems to be getting closer by the day, those influences are going to come crashing head first into the realities of oncoming ecosystem collapse.

Lets say Kanye West has to watch as his third mansion in a row gets devoured by forest fire, or that pewdiepies uncle/aunt/nefew drowns in flash flooding, or an insta-ultra-influencer posts pictures of a freak tornado ripping through their street, or the resulting caravan of refugees come poring past from horizon to horizon.

If these hyper influentials are forced to deal with and address the collapse in their own lives, they may even do some research and have to go through the same reality shattering realizations that most of us here have already had to deal with. And unlike most of us, the height they fall from will be staggering. Imagine having devoted your entire life to the game of LIKES only to realize its all been a con, a complete sham, a hollow and meaningless accolade in the face of reality. Everything you ever found worth in was a pantomime going on in-front of a Holocaust.

I suppose some wont be able to take it. Some may be so far gone they never get past the denial, but some, I hope, might see the light.

The privileged position they find themselves in and the vast audience they hold sway over may suddenly become a place from which to sound the sirens. A place for them to weep and plead to their multitudes to change their ways (as useless as that may be) but it could certainly be a piercing upset into certain echo chambers that have remained closed to the real world.

My theory is that once a few major influencers are converted, it will cause a domino effect through the exact same avenues used to sell shoes and concert tickets. ""Influencers influencing the influencers,"" both up and down the spectrum of  online media. what one does surely effects the next because of how much status influencers give other influencers in order to justify their own perceived status. This of course would cause real upset with the hordes of loyal click-bate pawns and send shockwaves through the as yet untouched parts of privileged society.

Think of how many people actually started to think about climate change, even on a very basic level, just because of David Attenboroughs ""Climate Change The Facts"" who would have still been oblivious or in denial. Not because the facts themselves were new or even completely accurate, but because it was Attenborough who was presenting them.

The only flaws in that idea, far as I can tell, are:

a) Some people simply don't mix with psychedelics, and using psychedelics would be detrimental to those people.

b) The ones who respond well to psychedelics and are interested in using them for self-improvement are probably already on board with doing whatever they can do to help the world.

288;"There's a chart I've been watching closely for a couple of months that defines the jet stream and the polar cell.  For years I have paid attention and looked at various images, and I tried to understand the system, but I never understood the system.  Now I love this chart.  The 500 millibar geopotential height chart.  GFS forecasts it out to +16 days at a resolution of 44 miles.  Can you believe that?  Well, every decade brings about another day of skill to the weather models, and we're somewhere in the 7-10 day range for good weather forecast.  Beyond that the results get less reliable.

https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=nhem&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn

This is an important service.  I think the above website earns whatever support it gets.

The atmosphere is about 1000 millibars of pressure at sea level.  I guess the American unit is inches of mercury.  it's a measure of pressure.

500 millibars is the middle of the atmosphere by weight

""Ranging in elevation from 16,000 feet (4,980 meters) to nearly 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) this is considered the ""middle"" of the atmosphere. It is based upon the assumption 500 mb is one-half of 1000 millibars (at sea level) and the top of the atmosphere, zero millibars""
 https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/500mb

Incidentally, at 16,000-20,000' (500 millibars) atmosphere is 7.252 PSI or 14.765"" of mercury!  And millibar is the same as hectopascal.

Behold.  Like an MRI slice of The Polar Cell.  https://imgur.com/a/lDF5IBM

""The average height of the troposphere is 18 km (11 mi; 59,000 ft) in the tropics, 17 km (11 mi; 56,000 ft) in the middle latitudes, and 6 km (3.7 mi; 20,000 ft) in the polar regions in winter."" (wikipedia).  Above that, Stratosphere. 

And in the arctic polar cell, the stratosphere kicks up a nice vortex in winter that reaches from the stratosphere almost down to ground level.  This is the polar vortex.  Usually the observation is of the polar vortex at the TOP, at 10 millibars or 70 millibars level.  When centered over the pole & stable, winter is calm & collected.  At ground level in the Arctic, winter temperatures are on average -50C.  It's an extremely cold area vs. the mid-latitudes.

There are actually 3 bodies of air circulation in the Northern & Southern hemisphere.  We have something called the Ferrel Cell.  When you see this, you instantly understand the Polar vortex:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqM83_og1Fc  Of course, it's a low pressure region.  It rotates counterclockwise, as lows do in the northern hemisphere.  In fact, its winds press on ferrel cell winds which press on hadley cell winds, like a 3 gear system.  it runs!  Remove one of the cells, however, and it'll jam up.

I've come to see the Ferrel Cell as something amazingly beautiful.  It's a complexity in the fluid dynamics of the earth, under which all the wonderful prosperity we enjoy has come to grow.  It's like the earth is blowin a tune.  It's got an extra set of rings on it, geez.

I'm not a scientist.  That immediately looks to me like a blessing we've been living under and MUST be part of the calm & stable past 10,000 years of climate.  OF COURSE that system would fail abruptly.  It might even be robust and contribute to the stability of conditions on Earth, but if you push it too hard it will break.  OH!  NO WONDER we're got all this marvelous population and wealth & technology.  We're in a very special and rare time in Earth's history.  It grew superapes.

but in Earth's history, climate was not always so stable.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian#/media/File:EPICA_delta_D_plot.svg

In fact, periods of stable climate are rare.  The best example of this is the Eemian, 115,000 years ago.  A similar period of climate stability like ours.  Little bit shorter in duration, and it started off very warm and then cooled down before reglaciation.

So we have an Ice age, 6 banded, 10,000 year old superclimate that grew superapes.

There's another way the atmosphere of the world can circulate.  It's called Equable climate.  This is when air rising at the equator flows across the top of the troposphere, all the way to the pole before decending again.  This is hothouse climate.  Equable, because the relative difference in temperature from equator to pole is less.  It's Hell at the equator, tropical temperatures at the poles.

In Equable climate, the entire tropics becomes Total Desert.  No moisture can reach the surface.  All moisture will evaporate away.  The average temperature of interior land areas are 120F.  The Sahara average temperature is 86F.

In the oceans, the tropics support no life.  In such periods of time in Earth's history, the tropical oceans are completely anoxic.  Something like shale would deposit at the ocean floor, because whatever can exist at the very surface of such seas, photosynthesizing, would fall through the sterile ocean to the sterile floor and become fossil fuels again. 

During such times in Earth's history, you had frost-intolerant plants growing on islands in the Arctic Ocean, along with crocodiles.  Cycads, which are completely intolerant to frost, grew on Svalbard Island when Svalbard was just as far north as today.

You might expect to see such heat during thermal maximums, like some thing that would develop 100 or 1000 years after humans were gone from global warming.  I feel like the climate will be in transition from Ice Age to Hothouse from presently until around 2035.

The first climate models were made in rotating tanks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy5Faz_tj8s

and here's another test done with a spinning rod

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcmDVAaEfKw

So, the thing about Arctic Sea ice is this:  it's what drives the  strong polar vortex condition in winter.  All the time, the air from the Hadley cell, which is heated in the tropics, is headed for the north pole.  That heat wants to reach the cold.  But the polar cell prevents this by being so cold, it whips up another circulation entirely.  This is the Ferrel cell.

The way I understand it, losing the cold lens of fresher water under the Arctic Sea ice is catastrophic.  The system would no longer be cold ice surrounded by warmer land.  The opposite.  And there's a good chance that arrangement won't be as pretty as the way it was for the past 10,000 years.  There's a good chance the transition from Ice Age to Hothouse could take 3-10 years.

299;"Have been following Guy's presentations for a few years, listening and watching without committing to his prognostications because I think it's important to hear and take in all information to come to the best working internal theory of why things are happening. Take some things, leave some things.

For years I thought his timelines were a bit wonky, but I took away the core message that there are numerous self reinforcing feedback loops which are not accounted for in the literature, and that the IPCC report says that geoengineering is necessary but that others have said that geoengineering can't work. I also took away his points about global dimming from industrial civilization basically shielding us from another degree or so of warming, and that if we turn off the cars, tankers, trucks, and coal plants, we'll immediately get that extra heating happening. Not to mention his citing all the ways in which our society is cancerous and awful in other ways.

He used to say that we needed to stop the ""omnicidal heat engine"" of society, but he just spat out a video saying that, no, because of global dimming, we now need to keep the omnicidal heat engine going if for no other reason than to prevent the loss of global dimming.

Think what you will about Guy. I know he is hated and loved in a highly divided way, and I don't care to discuss his sanity or character, but I do find it fascinating why or how he now basically thinks we need to come up with technofixes. He used to be vehemently opposed to these.

I see the history of climate change - the trends of 1930's looking like the temp was dropping for ever in an ice age phase. Sulphur particles due to world war post production - but they didn't know that then... (some say there was a large ""warming"" consensus even back then, but thanks to online archives a tally was made in the last month and cooling was certainly a consensus at one point in time).         

Remember Acid Rain killing all the trees in Europe, and eroding all the sandstone buildings? I survived that. So did the trees.            
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717290-400-europes-forests-fall-to-acid-rain/          

Remember the ozone hole? I survived that. (Some news sources suggest the holes not going anywhere for decades, even though we saw a ""We solved it"" posts just a month or two ago! Interesting stories if you go looking for it)               
https://theconversation.com/the-ozone-hole-is-both-an-environmental-success-story-and-an-enduring-global-threat-100524

https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/1379/2018/             

We've not had the mother of all pandemics since the Spanish Flu of 1918. Healthy middle aged people where malnourished due to war - chances are we won't see one until well into collapse when the worlds (even first world - where people travel by plane) people are again malnourished.      
The Red Death, and the Black Death came and went...

Then the global warming ideas - where EVERYWHERE would be heating up. Remember the 2005 headlines ""NO MORE SNOW AT CHRISTMAS!""?                  
That was the story - that kids would not see snow after 2010 anywhere due to global warming.                 
**https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/snowfalls-are-now-just-a-thing-of-the-past-the-independent.pdf** << They even DELETED it from their archives to ""whitewash"" climate change!

**http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Weather/The-Effects-Of-Global-Warming-On-Skiing**          

Then it was changed to ""Climate change"" - because **scientists didn't understand the climate**, or at least the news reporters that jumped to the ""no snow at Christmas"" conclusions - the snow didn't go away in the winter, and climate deniers pointed and strawmanned ""Look! It's all rubbish!""        
The scientist discovered extremes happened instead - extreme heat, extreme cold. It was changed to ""Climate Change."" to reflect the new understanding.                     

Along the way - **every time** - people were sure about the future - but it seldom works out the way they think.                 
The ski resorts are still open, the winters still happen, flu goes around, the crops still grow.

And, even the Iks, whose social structure had completely collapsed according to Colin Turnbull who wrote about them in the 1970s (although his acct was a bit biased because the Iks didn't know homosexuality and refused to supply a boy to him), have made something of a revival.

Plus, social control and tech are much more advanced than any of the cultures tainter had described, and complexity can be handled very efficiently with AI and other information tech.

In ancient times the ruler did not know a rebellion in the hinterlands. Now drones can fly within 5 min of such incident. Some guy in Texas operates drones which destroy wedding parties in Afghanistan, long the grave of many armies.

With that kind of control, sudden collapse is not possible.

315;"**EDIT**:  Is there any way we can draw down enough CO2 to change this outcome?

As at 2019 the atmosphere can absorb no more than 420 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 to avoid 1.5 degrees. This is known as our carbon budget. At 1.5 degrees, we loose our protection from several feed backs kicking in. These feed backs include permafrost and clathrates venting, forests burning globally, and the ocean's inability to store additional CO2. Accordingly, we need to stop well before 1.5 degrees.

Given the annual emissions from all anthropogenic sources are approximately 40 Gt CO2, have 8 years to stop all CO2 in order to avoid 1.5. This needs to stop 100%, as in no cars, no jobs and no industrial activity of any kind. Preferably we get no where near 1.5, but if we chose that number, then in this time we need to:

* Shut down all CO2 created by human activity, or
* Shut down most CO2 and sequester some of what is in the atmosphere already

As there is no technology ready to start large scale sequestration and not time to plant enough trees to make a difference, the conclusion is obvious.  The science says were not stopping at 1.5c, and instead will carry on to 2c and mostly like much higher due to additional feed backs.  Anything above 1.5c is civilization destroying and will ultimately result in the deaths of most if not all humanity.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Climate Change & Global Warming: General;?;?;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

318;"Firstly, **buying local ssourced meat and veggies does more for the environment then going vegan, deal with it**

The whole world going vegan would offset less then 15 cargo freighters out of around 11,000.

Animal emissions make up around 14%. Land vehicles make up around 24-25%. As for containerfreighters, It has been estimated that just one of these container ships, the length of around six football pitches, can produce the same amount of pollution as 50 million cars. The emissions from 15 of these mega-ships match those from all the cars in the world

But how many cargo freights are active, you may ask. Well the answer is around 53,000 merchant ships trading internationally, some 11,000 ships were bulk carriers.

At this point I would just like to point out that bulk Carriers are different from general cargo ships, which make up about a third of total merchant ships at Around 17,000 and are smaller then BCs but still pretty fuckin big, and that doesn't even account for the other 23,000 short sea ships, cruise ships(not a merchant vessel so it's not part of the statistic but they pollute a lot too), containerships and specialised vessels which still can get pretty fucking big.

If animal Ag produced the same % of emissions as land vehicles(~25%) everyone going vegan would offset about 15 of those ships at the most out of 11,000 carriers(once again this does not include the other~40000ish merchant ships are cruise ships). Since animal ag makes up less it ultimately off sets less then 15 ships.

And while animal ag has other environmental factors besides str8 up emissions, no more meat wouldn't stop that land from being cleared for crops for people(as population is only going to increase and farmable soil is going to deplete due to climate change, monocrops, etc.) Removing meat would stop the transportation emission probable because those same refrigerator trucks and ships and planes would be used to transport veggies instead of meat, and those veggies would still go to refridgerated isles in grocery stores.

The vast majority of animal emissions also come from beef, goats and chickens for example, emit the same amount(generally) as some crops. If everybody ate strictly goat and chicken, animal emissions would not even be a problem.

Which is why I think str8 up stopping eating meat isn't the best way forward, incentives for people to learn permaculture and start gardens on their property supplemented by goats and chickens(which contribute to the plants as well as providing dairy, eggs, and meat when too old for other things) is the best way to handle it.

I also see more people switching to a different kind of meat more likely then people no longer eating meat as a whole much more likely.


#**Tl,dr**:

if you ditch beef, you can still go for goat and chicken which emit roughly the same as veggies and eliminate the vast majority of animal emissions at the same time, combined with permaculture techniques it wouldn't be hard to create a self sustaining thriving environment  in your backyard

https://medium.com/@victoria27/heres-how-much-pollution-shipping-containers-and-freight-trucks-cause-b358cb034c70

Edit:raising your own animals giving them a good life and putting them down humanely would also be a better bargain  then they get in the wild and would cut down on factory farm abuse. Emissions and recources for goats and chickens are roughly the same as rice and wheat

Edit 2:Another thing you missed is that vegan diets usually do not contain enough choline, calabumin (these two only found in meat, dairy and eggs or from factory manufactured products via extensive microbe fermentation which itself then has a CO2 and infrastructure cost). Additionally calcium and iron are also lacking and are made up via dietary supplements which also require infrastructure for thier creation that would be deleterious on a global pop scale when contrasted with a ovopescatarian with limited pasture for sole meat animals. Overall I agree that our problem with big ag is we consume more meat than we should, but it's also wrong to assume we can solve all our woes by pure 100% future magic AI veganism.

We are at a crucial turning point in our history. This is what our cultural narratives of rising up and joining together have been pointing to all this time.

328;"Hello fellow collapseniks. We are past the point of this subreddit being niche, so hello to the oldsters, hello to the new oldsters like myself, and hearty welcome to the big wave we??e had this past year as the realization has gone mainstream that the climate is screwed. That itchy feeling something wasn?? right was an accurate feeling! Sorry it is a rough ride finding out about all this stuff. No easy way to rip off the band-aid. It?? mentally analogous to Neo waking up to the Real World in a body he had never used in a world he had never felt. Welcome to the other side of reality!

That welcome out of the way, the reason I made this self-post is because I see an increasing number of posts regarding ??he sky is falling, so what do I do about it???This is a really excellent question and I don?? think there are many excellent answers. I cobbled together a few answers of my own since I discovered in 2016 that everything about our current industrial civilization degrades all the living systems of this biodiverse planet. My politicians aren?? going to solve this problem and neither am I, little old, weak, ignorant me. As some of you seem to be posting about, how then does one not immediately give in to despair?

You have to do what you love. That is such a tired phrase I hate to say it, but I have my own real world examples of what that 90s cliche means in the world as it actually is. I put money and time and perhaps too much faith into some cows, because I thought holy shit if the world ends, at least I can shepherd some cows around and trade for meat. I was that dire in my predictions about 2019-2020! I thought I would be wandering the plains, eating cow with friends who helped me defend those cows, mostly concerned about finding enough non-poisoned water.

Well things didn?? get so bad so fast, thank goodness, but I did glean some valuable skills. I am now leveraging my limited, real, actual time and effort into finding a mentor on a homestead I can one day take over. That was NOT my plan, but that?? where I have ended up, simply because I followed what I love.

Another, less extreme example is volunteering my time. I am no hero, much as I would like to be. I?? just some guy. But there are people out there doing great work, spreading [the ideas](https://charleseisenstein.org/video/the-core-themes-of-climate-a-new-story/) that are going to save another few lives in the catastrophe we all feel is coming. I am no author, I have no book, so instead I practice what I read. I dedicate time to transcribing Charles Eisenstein?? works, because I think the [more people realize](https://charleseisenstein.org/video/a-message-to-greta-thunberg-and-the-youth-climate-strikers/) the depth of the problems we face the better. It?? not all about carbon emissions guys, much as we would like it to be that simple. To quote a fine author, ??ven if we reduce emissions to zero, the world will still die a death of a million cuts if we continue to degrade and damage the organs and tissues of this living earth.??
So there are a couple of my beginner's hints for how to deal with the end of the world as we know it. Because that?? where we are, already at the end. It was not as exciting as the movies promised, and it is lasting quite a bit longer than the rapture everyone has been keening for since the advent of nuclear power. We poor suckers are left to pick of the pieces of a ruined dream. Money won?? feed us, screens won?? satisfy our minds, and VR will never replace the feel of reality. For better or worse, we are here, stuck here until our bodies won?? let us be anymore. And I for one am going to fight like hell to make sure at least a few of us make it through to the nicer times coming. We are all in this together, and we just have to try.

Wishing you food and water enough,

337;"This is a very simple question that I struggle with. The answer should be simple: looking online I see that we are close to 500ppm CO2eq ([https://www.co2.earth/annual-ghg-index-aggi](https://www.co2.earth/annual-ghg-index-aggi)).

The problem is that doing the calculation myself gives a completely different result. I asked the owner of the page above and he said he takes its data from NASA so I should ask them.

Instead, I am curious what the community thinks. Here are my calculations (data from gov sources: [https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/current\_ghg.html](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html), [https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/](https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/))

I only looked at three gases, their concentration in ppm and their global warming potential (GWP) in CO2eq:

CO2, 415ppm, 1

CH4 1.8ppm, 100\*

N2O .3ppm, 300

&#x200B;

\* Note: I use the 10 year GWP for methane because its concentration keep increasing. See for example these articles: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/), [http://www.anchorageromneys.com/2019/06/insurmountable\_opportunity/5/](http://www.anchorageromneys.com/2019/06/insurmountable_opportunity/5/)

Alternately, we can use its GWP for 20 years (84) but that would not change the calculation much.

&#x200B;

So the total is:

**685ppm CO2eq**

I?? currently taking an art history course about the history of nature in European art, and nature as an escape/refuge/etc. from the city is a recurring theme from the Renaissance onwards.  Depending on the time period, setting, and piece, nature was a place of leisure, of rest, of exoticism, whatever, but it was always meant to be a respite from urban life and civilization in some way. If you were rich, you had a city house and a country house. Rich people constructed countryside villas emulating the ones of ancient Rome that incorporated gardens into their design.

Writers, too. Of course there?? Thoreau and Walden (although I think I read somewhere he still went into town once a month?) There?? a Korean poet whose name I?? blanking on who did something similar.

Of course most of this art ignored the nasty bits of nature like the possibility of getting bitten by a venomous snake or the discomfort of being caught in a storm or something, but there?? a history of people being drawn back to nature.

Why is it that centeredness and balance is interpreted as indecisive fence-sitting, while extremity is viewed as a sign of good character? Have you not noticed ALL murderous tyrants and despots without exception ascribe exclusively to one political ideology or another? In chemistry, if a solution's pH is too basic or acidic, it is equally hostile to life and it's functions, regardless if it be excessively left OR right of the scale. To clarify the metaphor, Stalin was bleach; Hitler acid. 


In any case, the distinction between a Communist and a Fascist becomes blurred once you observe their impact on society as a whole. 


We have no need for unenlightened, dualistic tribal squabbling, nor have we a need for final solutions or utopian visions. We have need of simple, ordinary virtue as well as heterogeneous cooperation. Before we agree to place our differences aside, it is not necessary we all be united by a common vision, only that we understand (in practical terms) the need for a ceasefire and a reallocation of resources on behalf of the common good in opposition to a common enemy. In our time, that enemy is climate change and no other. Conflicts of class and race can be resolved once everyone aboard a sinking ship are given transport to safe harbor and ordinary conditions are restored.

358;"Hello Kollapsniks!

The moderation team has gotten together to hash out a revised set of rules that we think will help us to deal with the higher subscriber numbers and visits we've been getting.  Our changing demographic has led to some interesting challenges and we feel that the current ruleset falls a little short when it comes to making this a community we can all feel good about participating in.

Nothing here is too groundbreaking.  In particular, we want to focus on relevance (as always) and defining it in a clearer way.  We also want to crack down on content that is primarily political in nature or otherwise better suited to other subreddits.  Please note that this does _not_ mean that economics, the environment and politics are completely off the table.

We'd also like to codify a shitpost day where all of these rules, aside from the reddit content policy, are off the table.  Friday seems like a good day for this.  We might also look into bringing prepper and survivalist material in on a specific days as well.

Now this is a proposal, not a proclamation.  We value your feedback and want to hear from you so we can make this work for most of you.  Please use this thread to discuss these new rules and let us know what you think!

Shoutout to /u/st31r and /u/OrangeredStilton for helping to get this together and moving the process forward.

---

1. Posts must be about collapse, not adjacent to it. By way of analogy, we want to talk about why there are so many car accidents; we don't want to talk about the gory details of every car accident.
1. If the subject matter of your post has less focus on collapse than it does prepping, the environment, politics or economics then it probably belongs in another subreddit.  For clarification see [the addendum](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/wiki/rule2addendum)
1. No provably false material (climate science denial, chemtrails, cloud/lizard/snake people, etc)
1. No duplicate posts.
1. Audio and visual content must have an accompanying comment providing a synopsis. Alternately, a synopsis can be provided in a self-post along with a link to the content.
1. Low-effort content, punchlines, memes, pictures with text, tabloid and click-bate journalism and material lacking a basis in scientific reality may be removed without prejudice. Shitpost Friday will be the exception to this.
1. In addition to enforcing reddit's content policy, we will also remove comments and content that is discriminatory in nature.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Community Response: Meta-Discussion & r/collapse as Community;?;?;?;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

363;"The outrage fatigue is real. Do you feel it?

The media exposes us to ridiculous hyperbole, from both the liberal media and conservative media, and the middle ground of actual facts (what's left when you get rid of the emotional outbursts) seems to be disappearing. Our information-spheres on the most important issues are being reduced to a [""Dueling Carls""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-7mQhSZRgM) sort of situation.

Pick a side and get mad, or shut the fuck up. That's what the establishment wants. That's what the extremists who follow their particular flavor of the establishment want. The brainwashed. The media. All trying to take over our natural culture and drown it out with control mechanisms, through emotionally-driven hyperbole. It's a brain-hack to control a hundred million people, to override their ability to think with a culture of poisonous outrage that perfectly pushes their well-cultivated buttons.

They've made it so that the whole country is constantly triggered by important stuff. ""Trump"" is a triggering word, people instantly get emotional upon hearing or reading that word. This emotionality (be it positive or negative) keeps us from talking about the issues, because our emotional brains override our logical brains, and it can take minutes or hours to calm down enough to see things logically again. We're left in ""libtard snowflake"" mode or ""small-handed orange man is racist"" mode. Do you feel that twinge in your gut as you read those phrases? Do you feel yourself getting defensive? This means it is working, this emotion is the foot-in-the-door to ownership of your consciousness.

If what's left of our organic culture is replaced with a interwoven network of knee-jerk reactions driven by emotional responses, hyped up and reinforced across hundreds of millions of people by hyperbolistic media, then how do we fix it?

We detach from the media that no longer serves us or our interests. We detach from the media that generate our outrage that allows us to be so easily controlled.

Having this emotional distance doesn't mean you don't care about the issues, it simply means you don't let the emotions overwhelm you. Which in turn helps you understand the issues better. It is freeing yourself from the bondage of having well-crafted buttons for others to push, do not mistake this for callousness.

Every time we are presented with something to be outraged about, we must ask ourselves: There are ten million things to be sad about in this very moment in time, does this one actually matter in the scope of what is accomplishable? Is it getting us anything to be mad about this? Are we building consensus toward solution, or simply driving people who should be cooperating further apart?

Outrage is a powerful tool. Use it wisely and carefully, don't let it hijack you but instead use to chose it for yourself, because we only have so much if it. If we over-express outrage we as individuals, and even collectively as a society, can run in to outrage fatigue and then we become impotent. If our communal outrage gets eaten up by nonsense, then there's nothing left for the important issues. Worse off, they may get overlooked entirely in lieu of spending time beating up on strawmen versions of the other side.

For the first time in the history of mankind, the elites can make workers on their own, and they don't need people anymore.

In the past, they needed cheaper labor, so they at least tolerated the poor somewhat.

However, with the arrival of higher tech, a lot of tasks can be automated very easily. And robots can do a bunch of tasks 24/7, without getting sick, having strikes, or possibly impregnating the master's daughter or seducing the master.

Already, the days of a factory worker are dying. Even with existing tech alone, about 40% of all labor could be eliminated and the surviving ones would be like the Congolese mines where nobody who is not desperate would go near to.

The landowners and those who can get easy financing will be able to buy out every single property in the world, and if they have financial trouble they will be bailed out as many times as necessary, 'to prevent the economy from collapsing'.

Turchin, et al are still prescribed to the old rules, which died around the time of Obama. I am not.

The culling won't be done in one single shot. In the advanced world, it will be done in two generations, although if resource shortages grow acute something more drastic will be done. (That is another topic.)

In short, today's poor will not have any opportunity to better themselves, because they will be encroached and no opportunities will be available because of the super-efficacy of the financial system, and the rise of the cost of intangibles (rent, insurance, legal costs, etc) which will prevent new business from thriving.

So, for me the community only makes sense if you are building it from strong members.

One point that others have mentioned here is the pooling of wealth too. Shared power supply for 15 houses could be a much bigger and prettier one... but would require delicate handling (shared property rights, self-rationed use etc).

Seeing the weakness in the world, everywhere, I really do see it as a Galt's Gulch withdrawal of talented members to somewhere isolated from having to babysit the weaker members. Having people with some experience of violence is always handy, because it takes a special kind of idiot to believe it won't be required. That, or people who are insanely good at fixing things/getting them working... the age of mail order parts will also be gone.

 

What worries me is that no one will want to join until it is a functioning community, and all the hard work is done... and then many will want to join. How do I then encourage quality members early, and deter poor quality members later on.

387;"I wanted to create a wholesome service that anyone would use to meet people if they needed to, but not one designed to make money and take as much of your time as possible.

The main idea is for users to write a detailed description that includes stuff about them, what they like, what they want to see in other people's description... select from it the important words used for matching and based on that, get other people's descriptions, the ones you have the most in common with and are nearby.

It would work on the fact that your traits are expressed in the things you like or consider important, so things like TV shows, movies, books, sports, collapse and literally anything else could be used to match you with other people.

Its main purpose would be to have people meet in real life and it would be used for both finding friends or relationships and actively worked on to keep it decent to have at least one such service that anyone could use and would not prey on its users.

I initially started working on it to help with the global loneliness problem and for me to have a service I would use to find friends or a girlfriend as I very rarely find people who I really like. But after discovering this sub a couple of months ago I think something like this would be essential for creating tightly knit communities to start doing something about the economy and climate change.

This description based matching would be the first step to create such a service, but I think even with just this users would adapt to using it to get the best matches for them.

If you want to take part in creating something like this you can join r/similarity and you can also find more information about this service there or even test it. (right now there are not that many users so they are placed in the same area to help start the community and for testing)

We as a collective should be using humanities resources to completely save the planet, even if it?? too late we should be going down the ship trying to patch the holes and pour the water out the boat. Nothing else should matter, not the economies, not the politics

Instead, we??e in a sinking ship where those at the bottom saw the problem (a small hole) and went to warn everyone. Except nobody listened, but now the boat finally started tipping a few centimeters, but it?? an incredibly slow sink, it?? so slow that the sense of emergency isn?? there. Only we need the entire ship?? population to fix this problem, so there?? the dilemma

So you have your people who don?? notice the difference (most people) and the people who clearly see the difference and ignore it despite remembering what they were warned about. They ignore it because they figure a slow sink like this shouldn?? ruin their fun for the night

Then you??e got those people who welcome chaos and say if the boat is sinking, it?? suppose to sink and that?? just what boats do, it?? not our fault so we don?? have to fix it. So instead, they actually go against anyone trying to fix the sinking even if it?? only a few people

Then you??e got the people who will make money if they let the boat keep sinking. These people think they??l get on an escape boat before it?? too late. Only they don?? realize that the proximity of the capsizing ship will drag then underwater regardless

I hate all those people. Most of us, in this cute analogy I made, are a single group of like 5 people on a ship of 150. We??e the people that took the warning seriously and realized we?? need the entire ship to work together to collectively save all our lives. Only we know by the time the boat is vertical about to be swallowed by the ocean, the urgency will finally come for those other 150 people and it??l be far far far too late. So we??l sit on the boat ready to die knowing it was coming from the beginning.

Some of us will scream trying to get people to notice the sinking, but they??l call you crazy and ignore you. Some will try to patch the holes, but there?? too many and you don?? have the resources without the rest of the ship. Some will make plans to survive on a raft when the ships finally gone.

Ok I??l stop lol, Talking about collapse in the form of a sinking ship is fun... you can also add that the people who ignored the warnings and had fun instead, also decided to reproduce knowing the boat is going to sink. Let?? say in this scenario the reproduction process is fast enough for the child to be a fully formed person just at the right time for them to be swallowed in a painful death.

393;"In the United States, sociological research into the public response
to disaster has its roots in the Cold War. As the federal government
was indoctrinating school children in the ??uck and cover??method for surviving nuclear attack, it also was contemplating what a
postapocalyptic society might look like. Thus, with the threat of nuclear
war looming large in the public consciousness, federally funded
disaster researchers began to examine public response to past and
current disasters??rimarily natural ones??oping to gain insight into
how civilians might respond to nuclear attack.


Over the next several decades, sociologists produced a body of
research that identified some fundamental characteristics of postdisaster
human behavior. They observed that, in the aftermath of natural
disasters, most people engage in prosocial, helping behaviors;
antisocial behavior is the exception, rather than the rule.

 ??oth social cohesiveness and informal mechanisms of social control increase
during disasters, resulting in a lower incidence of deviant behavior
than during nondisaster times.??The research suggested
various explanations for these findings, including ??mergent prosocial
norms,??the tendency to suspend preexisting community conflicts to
focus on the disaster, and ??he emergence of ??herapeutic communities???in which disaster survivors come together to provide mutual
support.

Moreover, the research found that only a small minority of disaster
survivors suffer a ??hock reaction??that leaves them dazed, unable
to think for themselves, and dependent on others for rescue and guidance.
Indeed, community residents who survive the initial hazard
event are the true ??irst responders,??performing many critical life-saving
tasks, including searching for, rescuing, and caring for other survivors.
The research also suggested that true panic??haracterized by
irrational flight behavior??s not a typical disaster response.

As this body of research coalesced, sociologists began to
recognize that many of these findings conflicted with widely held perceptions
about postdisaster behavior.


 Among the most important of the disaster myths
identified were

(1) the myth of antisocial behavior, such as looting
and violence;

(2) the myth of disaster-victim shock; and

(3) the myth
of widespread disaster-induced panic

On the first of these myths, the myth of antisocial
behavior??pecifically, the myth of widespread looting and violence.

??ccording to
popular belief, antisocial behavior is widespread in the wake of a disaster??ooters
swarm into the unguarded, unoccupied homes; the police
must be put on patrol??ometimes the military must be called
in.??This belief is inconsistent with empirical findings.
It is exceedingly rare in the aftermath of natural disasters.

 Scholars have distinguished
sharply between riots and other civil disturbances (in which
looting is not only likely but is part of the mob?? message) on the one
hand and natural disasters (in which looting is exceptional) on the
other.


Sociologists have produced a compelling, coherent body of
empirical evidence demonstrating that prosocial behavior, rather than
antisocial, criminal behavior, is the predominant human response to
natural disaster.

 The Content of the Disaster Myth

Sociological studies have demonstrated that the public narrative
of disaster, particularly as conveyed by the media, focuses on unsubstantiated
claims of antisocial behavior at the expense of reporting
helping behaviors. This gloomy public narrative played out with a
vengeance during Hurricane Katrina.

It left in its wake an unspeakable trail of devastation and suffering??ome
1,500 fatalities, 80% of New Orleans under water, and
destruction up and down the Gulf Coast. Almost immediately, reports
of looting??nd, indeed, reports of extreme violence, including
murder and rape??egan to emerge from New Orleans.

There can be little doubt that the disaster myth of widespread
looting and violence influenced reporting about Katrina?? impact.
Sociologists have identified several distinct, but overlapping, narratives,
rooted in disaster mythology, that public officials and the media
used to portray post-Katrina New Orleans. In these narratives, looting??he
prototypical antisocial behavior identified in the disaster
myth??as inseparably connected with accounts of horrific violence.

One of the most prominent narratives or ??rames??the media employed
in its Katrina reporting was anarchy. While the reporting
used ??narchy??in a variety of senses???o connote an absence of authority,??particularly federal authority in Katrina?? immediate aftermath,
to ??eport[ ] violence, chaos, and Armageddon, end-of-days
hyperbole,??and to refer to looting and associated property damage ??ll
of these conceptions perpetrated a view of New Orleans as a
place where social norms had disintegrated and dangerous, uncontrolled
lawlessness prevailed.
