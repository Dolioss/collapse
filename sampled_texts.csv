Film of the Week: **The Age of Stupid (2009)**

Director: *Franny Armstrong*

Starring: *Pete Postlethwaite*

Running Time: *89 minutes*

Set in 2055, this is a bit of a mashup. Not really sure how to categorise it - part documentary, part dramatisation, we see Pete Postlethwaite ( [""the best actor in the world"" according to Steven Spielberg](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/04/pete-postlethwaite-film-actor) ,) as ""The Archivist"", reviewing the history of Mankind's inability to stop destroying the planet from the vantage of an Arctic redoubt in 2055, using news footage, documentary clips and animations from his global archive.

Profoundly sad, and a ""must watch"" for everyone really.

"28653","9wg5p3","I see on posts and comments people saying ""everyone just doesn't care."" There's a good reason for it. Most people don't care because they don't have the luxury to. They struggle to even keep their electricity on, to keep food in their children's stomachs, to keep a roof over their heads. You can't win people over by showing them an article and saying ""it's your fault"" or ""you have to care"" but you also can't just put the blame on big corporations even if they are mostly to blame. For the simple fact that these big corporations are what's keeping them just barely able to have a small amount of stability. 

You can't ask someone to quit their job because it's killing the environment. Because if they do they lose their income they can't pay bills they go hungry looking for a job that isn't helping to destroy the environment. Then their kids would suffer even more. I once thought the answer was to just move away, leave my country and pretend it'll just go away. But it's impossible to stop. It'll never go away and we have to accept that. We have to accept we can't get people to destroy their income for the planet. Even though the planet is the very reason we are able to live, our society has made it impossible to live without destroying it. So even if we are destroying the planet we can still live, eat and enjoy our short time on this earth. That's why people can't seem to care enough to do anything about it."

First post here. 

I don’t think there’s an answer to this question, but - say we get to, I don’t know, +4C by 2100. 

And say nobody does anything meaningful to address this forever, like we’ve been doing, but we’re not really driving global warning anymore on account of many of us being dead. 

Has anyone modeled what happens next? Do we stay at +4C for a few millennia?  Does it flip back? What does say 3000AD look like? 

I very much doubt anyone knows but I’d be interested to hear I was wrong."

My neighbor is giving birth right now, that child won’t make it to 30. I have found myself in the middle of all these predictions. I don’t agree that shit will go down in the next few years (could be wrong, but probably not) as people such as Guy McPherson have suggested. But I also don’t buy the 2100 meme. I think that the world will be 3-5 C warmer by 2050, tho that may be conservative as the IEA projected worse case 3.5 C by 2035. Most of us know the WWF reports on biodiversity and how we have lost about 60% in the populations of animals that they have been keeping track of. I don’t expect that number to be reversed as the “optimists” believe. I also don’t see the insects coming back. Yes, there are some species that have recovered, and that’s great! But that’s a needle in the haystack. Ocean acidification and ocean oxygen loss are both gonna get a lot worse in the coming years. This will further turn the oceans to shit. And then there is the looming BOE which looks likely sometime in the next decade. 

CONCLUSION

I don’t expect civilization to last past 2060.I would be very surprised if it did. I think somewhere between 2040-2060 the collapse will happen. So basically now till then, will be the slowish, depressing, painful, and gloomy transition. Enjoy the now. Because in a few decades, the lights will go out. And they won’t come back on. You will be left to fend for yourself. So be ready "

> The Mystery of Self-Organization
> 
> No mystery really. If you understand the principle of “profit”, you can come to understand the accretive process of complexity and self-organization. Generally speaking, profit in context of both organisms in the ecosystem and businesses in the economy is the net amount of energy remaining after deducting all costs of conduiting metabolic necessities. It’s what you can keep after everyone’s been payed. This amount represents an amount that can be put into conduit expansion, growth or reproduction. The more profit you make, the more copies of yourself you can make.
> 
> The winners become the extant conduits on the surface of the earth because they grow and reproduce at a rate faster than the others and eventually crowd them out. Self-organization is always a manifest result of seeking profit and putting said profit into expansion. The genes that underlay the tools of cells and regulate organization will sometimes mutate giving rise to new, potentially more profitable combination, but usually not. Human businesses are always trying to innovate to make their technological cells and organizations more profitable. The self-organization is simply the retention of profitable innovations, mutations and combinations. If some change results in less profit, then it is likely to be eliminated through competition. Over time, complexity accumulates by an accretive process, but each innovation has been tested as positive overall to profitability. Each species of business in a system may be profitable enough so as not to go bankrupt nor grow substantially except perhaps in some modulating repeating cycles. This is stability.
> 
> Humans however, even though showing some temporary staying power in their economies with many companies lasting many years, decades and perhaps centuries without going bankrupt or overwhelming the system, have used the modeling power of their minds to create innovation so fast that any kind of stability is impossible. They seek maximum profit at all cost by creating small innovations that result in slightly greater efficiency and effectiveness. Nature has included budgets for the recycling of most of the material present in the ecosystem, but mankind’s civilization has not. Neither have they taken into account the filling of metabolic waste sinks. Neither have they taken in to account the limited supply of energy at the base of their economies. Neither have they considered that their own RNA (humans) rely upon an ecosystem that the economies so eagerly consume. In other words, the self-organization of the economy is highly complex and rapidly evolving, but grows inside the ecosystem like a cancer. The ecosystem cannot in any way adapt to the cancerous presence as its evolution is much slower than in the wildly cancerous economy.
> 
> To sum up, self-organization is simply the retention over time of profitable traits used in the conduction of energy from gradient to waste. Mankind’s economy is no special case of divine intervention or “magical” technology. Even if it were not to destroy the ecosystem first, it would likely destroy itself through the shear speed of evolution and failure in recycling materials and emptying waste sinks. It’s like a cancer in that it dumps its waste into the general circulation from which it arose and feeds upon the mother system, often pushing aside and interfering with flows in the ecosystem. But we must welcome the unfettered competition to outfit the technological cells with artificially intelligent machines to likely produce products for other artificially intelligent machines, because the environment for humans and the prospect for any kind of good life will be extinct for humans.

"24826","96ukya","If there were to be a sharp increase in seismic and volcanic activity with little time to recover between catastrophes around world wide, what would collapse look like? How long would we be able to economically weather several natural disasters on a global scale? How many volcanos would need to go off to shift the global climate towards an ice age?

Also is open discussion ok on this subreddit as long as it's related to collapse? Apparently earthquake talk doesn't have a home here since it's not linked to societal collapse. There's already a two post per 24 hour limit. Not really interested in discussing collapse in geology communities since my only interest in seismicity is the social, economic, and environmental ramifications as they relate to collapse. 

My background is psychology and economics so there's interesting things in several topics that casual constructive banter would be fun in yet I rather not have to infiltrate their communities lol. But, I'm interested in all aspects and cycles of society, with a particular fascination on the fragility of it. 

Long story short I just like to frigging talk. 

Where does one find a community centered around collapse that's open to just casual collapse banter and information sharing? Any good IRC chats or Facebook groups? Alternate subs, any juicy collapse related communities. Something like that?"
"2921","61k0f6","Um... fuck no.  Probably because this continent is attaining record temperatures that have never before been seen, and the effects are so dramatic that world leaders are being flown there to witness the apocalypse in person.

Unlike some of the conspiracy theorists that like to think that global warming is a hoax, and that we really need to be worrying about ""global cooling"" (please someone explain this shit to me - how retarded can people be?) - the reality is that we're experiencing climate change at such an exponential rate right now that world leaders are beginning to take notice (well, except for Mr. Trump and his administration, but only fucking idiots would honestly deny global warming at this stage of the game).

There's a possibility that the changes occurring in the arctic and antarctic are so much worse than scientists originally predicted that world leaders are being flown there to ""see for themselves"".

This nonsense about alien life is honestly put forth to give people hope, hope that there's more intelligent life in the universe than ourselves - when in reality we're actually considerably less competent as a species than most of us would care to admit - so much so that we're heading directly off a climate cliff that's goign to lead to our own extinction.  Shit, we're so incompetent as a species that we can't even figure out how to clean up Fukushima after nearly a DECADE in the most technologically advanced country on Earth - you think we're going to figure out a way to harness alien technology and these so called ""energies of the future"" that Trump talks about?  

To those of you out there that believe all this fuss about Antarctica is about the discovery of some ancient pyramids, alien technology, or lost ruins, etc - please pass me that hopium pipe you're sucking on after your MASSIVE toke, because from the looks of it you're a bunch of fucking idiots. "

**Coastal defenses**

Due to  the pervasive and ever present ""fallacy of sunk costs"" the largest and  wealthiest coastal cities will probably be defended to the death in the  face of ever more violent storms and relentlessly rising sea levels. No  matter what the cost.

Anyone with  the civic engineering experience to design and build coastal flood  defenses will probably have a golden ticket right to the end

**Hospice care**

Millions  of aging baby boomers are starting to feel the existential angst that  comes with slowly realizing that they are responsible for permanently  fucking up the entire planet for their kids. And their kids. and their  kids. and..., well you get the idea.

Those  folks will no doubt be looking for a way to ""check out"" of that planet,  permanently. while they can still do it with dignity. Especially before  the bloodthirsty mobs show up to string them from a lamp post.

Anyone  with health care experience that can keep folks comfortable while the  die will probably have a golden ticket right to the end

**Emergency responders**

Millions  of people will be dying from famine, drought, pandemics, violent  storms, floods, and hellish heatwaves. Every year. For decades to come.

See ""Hospice care"" above.

**Virtual reality**

As  the world becomes increasingly bleak and uninhabitable there will be a  huge demand for escapist entertainment, and it doesn't get much more  escapist than virtual reality.

Anyone with video game design and software engineering experience will probably have a golden ticket right to the end

**Low tech electronics**

For  those not wealthy enough to maintain an internet connection and escape  into VR then for those folks it will be a day to day struggle just to  keep what they've got humming for a little while longer. People will be  desperate to keep their solid state electronics working and anyone with  electrical engineering experience who is handy with a multi-meter and a  soldering gun, well, maybe not a golden ticket, but you probably won't  go hungry either.

**Low tech machinery**

For  those not wealthy enough to maintain any electricity at all, then for  those folks it will be a day to day struggle just to stay healthy and  alive. Countless fossil-fueled and electronic labor saving devices will  no longer be available to them, and they will be desperate for low-tech  alternatives.

Anyone with  mechanical engineering experience who knows their way around a machine  shop full of hand tools, again, maybe not a golden ticket, but you  probably won't go hungry either.

**Mercenary**

This  pretty much goes without saying. If you have any kind of military or  weapons handling experience then there will no doubt be an abundant  supply of warlords and generalissimos looking to employ your services.

Again, maybe not a golden ticket, but you probably won't go hungry either."

Cuba has ~3.5 metric tons of CO2 emissions per capita annually compared to the US' ~16.5 (16.5 -> 3.5 is a 79% reduction in GHG emissions, almost identical to the figure the scientific consensus advocates)

"2141","5xkm3f","Mars is so inhospitable to life that the only feasible way to colonize the planet would be to re-engineer humans. Obviously this is not a realistic possibility any time soon, but was interestingly covered in an old SciFi novel by Frederik Pohl, [Man Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Plus):

> In the not-too-distant future, a cold war threatens to turn hot. Colonization of Mars seems to be mankind's only hope of surviving certain Armageddon. To facilitate this, the American government begins a cyborg program to create a being capable of surviving the harsh Martian environment: Man Plus. 

> In order to survive in the thin Martian atmosphere, Roger Torraway's body must be replaced with an artificial one. At every step he becomes more and more disconnected from humanity, unable to feel things in his new body. It is only after arriving on Mars that his new body begins to make sense to him. It is perfectly adapted to this new world, and thus he becomes perfectly separated from his old world, and from humanity.

> The success of the Martian mission spurs similar cyborg programs in other spacefaring nations. It is revealed that the computer networks of Earth have become sentient, and that ensuring humanity's survival will guarantee theirs as well...

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Plus

...


Elon Musk's stated reason for pushing so hard and fast to colonize Mars is that he believes a doomsday event is inevitable and that the only hope for the survival of humanity is to get off Earth, but...

* Given current projections, there is simply not enough time to get sufficient numbers of people off Earth and into a self-sustaining, off-world colony with the technological and manufacturing capabilities to develop further. 

* And Mars may anyway may be too inhospitable for any viable colony of humans -- big, delicate bags of water and meat -- without substantial re-engineering of the human physical form... something that, while not theoretically impossible, is so far beyond our current capabilities as to be science fiction.

...

Now, Musk isn't stupid. You don't create your own space program (amongst other things) by being stupid. And one thing a space program is very good for, besides launching stuff into orbit, is for obtaining significant government funding and to push rapid technological development in certain areas....

The implication now should be obvious. Musk's Mars program may be a program to fast-track development of an isolated sanctuary on Earth.  The large injection of funds aimed at developing technology for a harsh, inhospitable environment like Mars may actually be targeted at supporting a colony of humans on Earth in the not-too-distant-future. A project like this, if stated publicly, would attract far more criticism and far less funding (and Musk is already a target of much criticism).

"
"37486","byl8eh","I've lived in Sub-Saharan Africa for about a decade off and on. The nice parts, and the not nice parts. Like it or not, there are a lot of things I see every day that are very likely going to be the exact brand of thing we'll all see in the developed world as collapse takes place. 

First off, in terms of the 5 steps of grief, most of this sub is on steps 2 (anger), 3 (bargaining), and 4 (depression). Forget about it. We're too far gone. Accept it (step 5) as reality and let's hunker down. 

Not only that, but collapse won't be a single, big Hollywood-style event. It will be ebbs and flows. Ups and downs. But each down will drag us down farther than any ups will ever get us. But it won't hot everything equally. Things that grind money and hit dopamine feeder buttons in the brain will continue. In 20 years you'll have 7G internet, but you'll be hoarding things you find at the store. 

First off, let's look at the information environment now and what we'll get. My favorite thing about *A Song of Fire and Ice* (yes, the books, not GOT) is how well it portrays a low-information environment. Between 2004ish and 2016 we had a reliably good high-information environment. But in the future, we'll go back to low info because the volume of noise covering the info you need, intentionally distracting bullshit, and conflicting but convincing uncorroborated info. Even if you have a few sources of info you trust as being truthful, there's just as much out there to tell you that's all wrong. The only people you'll believe are people you know have personal experience with the topic at hand. Everything from your internet searches to your PII will be aggressively used and abused, by both legal and illegal criminal elements, to try and get you to give up everything you have. You won't trust any business as legit unless you know people that work there. 

Next, rule of law. It will erode and corruption will be as common as sea level rise. To be honest, IMO, rule of law, quality infrastructure, and a system that funnels resources into the country at a disproportional rate are the majority of what keeps the ""Developed"" world developed. There's a feedback loop where government is corrupt, so why bother giving them resources, then they can't do their jobs, so they do a bad job, so why give them resources, so they do a bad job. As competition for resources increases, corruption will appear. This will erode rule of law. If you don't have a good relationship with the cops, or someone connected to them, you might as well not call them. They'll show up and ask for money to do their job unless you know someone that can fire them. They only have the job because it's a combination of power and money they can't find elsewhere. Same for politicians, government workers, etc. So when you get a bunch of useless people in every aspect of government, everywhere, people stop respecting the government. They engage in the black market, they don't pay taxes because they can pay less to bribe their way out of it, and they do whatever they want and expect to give a cop a few bucks to get out of any trouble. This isn't individual anecdotes and the odd news story, this is how everyone knows every day happens all the time. 

This will cause inefficiencies everywhere. The kind of gains of the digital economy will make in the next 5 years will be lost because people trying to flex a little power for a pay day will bring things to a standstill. A truck full of tomatoes shows up at the supermarket, but the local county health inspector is there holding his hand out waiting for a bribe or he's going to turn the truck around because of something confusing and likely bullshit excuse about paperwork. Prices go up. Shelves start to get a bit bare, save the products that have an iron-clad relationship with the supermarket and made all the right friends in government to execute good logistics. When you see a non-regular product come in, you buy a bunch and you horde it. You haven't seen coconut milk in 2 years! They have 12 cans, so you buy half of them. Not just for you, but so you can make a coconut cake and seem extra fancy. It's not like it was in the Great Depression. It's just one order of magnitude below that. It also means that instead of going to one store to get your shopping done, if you have money, you have to go to 3 or 4 stores to get everything. Climate change shocks will do things like flour will be impossible to get, and the stores will horde what they have to sell bread. 

These inefficiencies mean that your time is no longer as worthwhile. No one's is. Think of your favorite ""OMG, I'm a busy mom!!!11!!!!"" person. That's you every day. It takes you all day to get 1 thing done because things get needlessly complicated. So no one comes in on time to work. Most companies struggle to get and keep good workers unless they have a spouse who has time to do all the other shit you need to do. Staff at almost every place of business spend more time on social media than working, even though they only have the job to pay for their phone. People who have money and value their time will pay TaskRabbit people to do things like take $400 in cash to pay your power bill because you can't trust paying it online because the electric company always get hacked. 

Infrastructure will continue to crumble. Water, power, or internet: Choose two. Blackouts will be common and it will be expected that most people have a solar battery and inverter, and a water tank to save up 200 gallons when the water comes on. But people will get used to living that way. It will start so slow that no one will really freak out. Imagine Flint and their water issues happing everywhere. Who will you demand to fix it? The government? You don't trust them enough to give them tax money in the first place. 

Security is your job now. Walls with razor wire are luxury items. Thefts are common. Kidnappings for ransom happen just enough that there's also a fair number of fake kidnappings where someone calls you and says they have your SO. But they all they have is information skimmed from you online and within 5 minutes they get you to give them $2,000, and your SO was just at work the whole time and the ""kidnapper"" also knew they would be in a meeting and not answering calls. Americans who think their 2nd Amendment will help out with this will find out quickly that you can't shoot through the phone, you can't track on your own a van of dudes that took your sister, and you can't use a gun to defend against someone in a crowd blowing dust in your face that makes you susceptible to suggestion so they drive you to ATMs and drain your accounts until they shoot you. 

Medical care is a business, but unless you're wealthy, forget about it. Hospitals will spend a ton of time trying to fight against counterfeit drugs. Some places will run out of things like IVs or bandages or aspirin. 

Despite all this, people still manage to live regular ol' lives this way. They go out and see music, they get beers with the guys, they watch TV and have a Playstation. It just takes a lot more work, and you have to have your guard up 24/7. Community and your networks will become increasingly important as your only groups of trustworthy people. It's not the end of the world completely. Just the end of the world as you know it. A billion people or more live like this and enjoy their lives. There may be plenty of overlaps in some Asian countries as well, I'm not sure. I am sure that this is the future approaching us, and we just need to get ready."

Here are a few of my ideas:

-All nations would need to abandon personal ownership of vehicles. Only transport trucks/trains and farming machines would be allowed to function. All of humanity would need to permanently reduce use of fossil fuels by 90%.

-All nations would need to abandon large scale animal farming operations, the majority of society would need to subsist on a plant based diet.

-Developing/Undeveloped nations would need to abandon any hopes of living how developed nations already do.

-People in all nations would need to abandon almost all materialism and busy themselves with work in their own community, within bicycling distance of their home. I imagine this as the majority of all people living like Quakers.

-A Universal Basic Income would need to be paid to people to prevent mass starvation/rioting, or at the very least some structured and safe distribution of food/water/medical supplies.

-People of all nations would need to stop reproducing, and the goal of all humanity would to be bring human population down to 1 billion or less.

"35435","bklcj8","Collapse is often thought to be a catastrophic event like nuclear war or outbreak of biological weapons or swine flu.

However, what if capitalism is the tool that euthanises humanity slowly?

When a society is connected to global capitalism, birthrate falls. In subsistence agricultural societies, more children means more workers on the farm. In manufacturing or services economies, children are a luxury good. Have children and you set back your wealth growth. Having children means you become poorer. As such, human population growth dwindles as capitalism is imposed. The UN estimates global human population will rise to 10 billion by 2050 but thereafter will fall. This assumes continuing capitalism. 

Capitalism also reduces natural resources. More coal and iron ore is dug out. Oil is pumped out. Rare earth metals are dug out from the ground. As natural resources get rarer and rarer, the scarcity will increases prices, which increases the cost of breeding even more thereby reducing the incentive to breed.

Then as natural resources are depleted, humans will just stave to death, but by then there will be few humans around."

A splendidly bleak slice of doom this week, sees a lone survivalist living in a cabin in the woods after the oil runs out and the population crashes.

Growing a meagre plot of crops, while trying not to attract the attention of roving bands of raiders, his days are filled with hard work and loneliness, until one day a mother and daughter turn up at his door, and an unlikely alliance is formed.

1) more land in the north, less water to buffer the temps  
2) ice albedo loss: a huge and sudden north-localized source of warming

Probably others that I'm missing.  But the point is that the cold regions in the northern hemisphere will bear the brunt of global warming initially.  So while temps in the north are rising by a LOT, temps in the south are rising by a little.  Of course the equator will start pushing up on the limits of agriculture first, but this sub mostly discounts the damage done by sudden transients.

"41052","cl59xk","About Yesterday's Post: **Top 20% = 70% Emissions | Ignoring Billionaires Will Kill Us All**

I spent 10 years promoting James Hansen 100% private carbon taxes with zero success, but I guess there's a lot of new blood in this sub, because yesterday's ""throwaway post"" was a big hit, and a bigger surprise to me. This is a corrected and referenced version. I'm very heartened by the interest.

**100% Dividends = 0% to the government + 100% to the citizen**

The very foundation of Hansen's proposal is that **all** of the tax money goes 100% back to the people, to those who will bear the brunt of a carbon tax, the poor. I define the poor as the bottom 40%. Kevin Anderson says that the top 20% of earners produce 70% of emissions. 

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/unnamed-file.jpg

10 years ago, James Hansen introduced us to a 100% private carbon tax, which he called a ""Fee & Dividend"" on February 25, 2009.

**Carbon Tax & 100% Dividend vs. Tax & Trade**

http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2009/WaysAndMeans_20090225.pdf

Hansen believes cap'n trade has failed. A 100% dividend means 0% for government, and 100% to the public, notably the poor. This would be the equivalent of a UBI; but instead of just ""free money"", the poor would be paid to fight carbon emissions. This would unite left and right, and drive a new green economy based on climate justice and equality. It puts the horse in front of the wagon, and the carrot in front of the horse.

**The “Carbon Fee & 100% Dividend” as the best potential to initiate cause and effect that will lower CO2 emissions**

http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/economics

Hansen came out with his plan in the news.

**James Hansen rails against cap-and-trade plan in open letter**

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/12/james-hansen-carbon-emissions

**Hansen's plea fell on deaf Obama ears.** Obama supported cap'n trade.

http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5962

""We will establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 percent by 2050,"" Obama said.

**Emissions went up 10-15% since 2009**

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emissions2.jpg?w=696

**In 2015, Hansen tried again at COP21, without success, again**

https://atomicinsights.com/james-hansen-takes-stage-at-cop21-to-explain-carbon-fee-and-dividend/

In 2013, Bernie Sanders introduced a fee and dividend bill that would allow the government to keep 40% of any carbon tax dividend, essentially neutering Hansen's vision. It was a con job using the same language of fee and dividend, but allowing the government to keep 40% of it. It was highly celebrated in the green press.

https://grist.org/climate-energy/sanders-and-boxer-introduce-fee-and-dividend-climate-bill-greens-tickled-pink/

**James Hansen, Ph.D. - The Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity - Offstage** Hansen explains how the US could export 100% dividends to the world.

https://youtu.be/2QvVzE1Gn54

It's my contention that renewable energy is little more than a fraud without a 100% dividend, as evidenced by Solyndra and Solar City.

Renewable Fraud

**Solyndra misled government to get $535M solar project loan: report**

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/26/solyndra-misled-government-get-535-million-solar-p/

China controls 70% of the world solar market and has recently cut solar production 40%, and lowered subsidies, because they had more solar panels than their grid could handle.

**Solar Down 40%**

https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/chinas-bombshell-solar-policy-could-cut-capacity-20-gigawatts#gs.t3votc

**Is Elon Musk's SolarCity circling the drain?**

https://www.treehugger.com/solar-technology/elon-musks-solarcity-circling-drain.html

**Kevin Anderson says that in the last 30 years, emissions have gone up 60%.**

https://www.carbonneutraluniversity.org/delivering-on-2-degrees---kevin-anderson.html

After 30 year of trying, solar and wind are less than 3% of total world energy use. Do you see that thin orange sliver in the link below, that's how pathetic solar and wind growth are. What good are low solar panel prices, if they don't solve anything? They have to be backed up with a 100% dividend. Even then, we're not out of the woods, but at least we're honestly trying. 

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bp-2018.jpg?w=696

European green energy fraud is almost indescribable. In northern Europe they get over 50% of their renewable energy by burning imported trees. They burn palm oil in their diesel fuel and lie about the emissions. Their cap'n trade system is so corrupt, the only people making money off it are the fossil fuel companies. In northern Europe, they burn plastic and paper for electricity and call it ""recycled energy"".

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/pge-california-outage.html?module=inline](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/pge-california-outage.html?module=inline)

They did not enjoy it."
"12054","7dptdr","At 3C warming above pre-industrial, the ability to maintain civilization in many currently 1st world places is straining now at 1.4 C, it will likely falter in the 2 C range, and in many places it will likely collapse in the 3C range. 

**Background:**

Collapse is not equally distributed; it does not occur everywhere at the same time, nor does it play out everywhere at the same speed. At the point when some currently 1st world nations are collapsing, others will merely be faltering, and perhaps a few still merely straining as many are now. What I'm wondering about is, how will that play out? 

To get a sense of what the population movement aspect of collapse may look like, we can look at the arguably currently collapsing and collapsed nations based on number of refugees leaving (Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan) and based on the most negative net migration per capita *as of 2012* (Syria, Libya, Micronesia, Georgia), a few commonalities become clear. These are all relatively small countries, and they are all militarily and economically weak. Most of these nations are under strain of one or more foreign powers, and most of these are under climate/environmental/resource strain. As a result most have resorted to some form of civil conflict (civil war, secession or revolution), and many are fleeing the violence.  The educated and wealthy classes legally emigrate to 1st world nations, the skilled class with some resources legally emigrate to neighboring nations, and the poor emigrate as refugees. However, if the collapse is fast enough (as it was in Syria), more of the spectrum wind up leaving as refugees. 

As for causes of collapse, in the above examples, climate/environmental/resource strain is a minor to moderate element in most cases, while cultural problems in the broadest sense (religious clashes, interference by foreign powers, etc), are usually a larger part of the cause. In the future, the climate/environmental/resource strain will likely be the larger part. 

**The Questions:**

There are three major countries in North America (Mexico, the US, and Canada), a couple dozen small countries in Central America and the Caribbean, and Greenland. The smaller countries will likely collapse in ways similar to the above examples, with its people emigrating on an individual basis and in small groups. The big three absorb them or repel them with minimal strain. 

It's different when larger nations falter. Mexico hasn't yet collapsed, it's only faltering with its drug war (civil conflict) and many have been leaving for the US, to such an extent that it changed the US's demographics, its politics, and intertwined the US to Mexico in a way it wasn't previously. If this is what the faltering of Mexico does to the US, what will its collapse do? 

The same question goes for the US. Looking at the 3C and 4C warming forecasts with outcomes that significantly reduce food production, destroy infrastructure, reduce water availability, and in many places surpass wet bulb hard limits of livability, it appears likely that the US will reach a point where civil conflict and emigration play out. However there is one fascinating detail: *Unlike* all the above nations mentioned, the US is militarily and demographically stronger than all of its surrounding neighbors. 

My question is, when the US begins to falter as Mexico has been for a decade, how do you think this will play out? Clearly, northward movement is part of the answer, but just what will move northward? Will it just be people? Will institutions somehow move also? Will it be regulated by Canada and Greenland, or will the US government influence this even as it is collapsing? Will the US military merge with that of Canada, or will it face some other outcome? Will the core of US government and the military relocate to Alaska and abandon the lower 48? Or is there some other way this might play out?

I know no one really knows or can be sure, I was just interested in what you all might think are the most likely outcomes?

This is a question that seriously haunts me. Do we all need to be planning to get far underground? Should we be planning a future  where what's left of civilization rebuilds under the earth? It seems to me that we may be facing a much bigger problem when the electricity stops than what we generally think to recognize. Are we actually facing full on extinction of all life on earth from this issue alone? From what I'm reading about it, most reactors have about a month or so backup power to keep the water pumps cooling the rods. And then there's the issue of the pumps cooling all the ""spent"" rods (many times the number of rods in use.) What are we really looking at here? If all the plants in the US or, God forbid, on the planet melted down - we'd be looking at an earth in which radiation levels wouldn't return to a livable level for 10s of thousands of years. Do we need to start digging into the earth to escape? What's the answer here. Are my concerns unfounded or overblown? Is there a way to get these places to shut down safely before it's too late? How do we convince the world this is necessary and demand such, if that's even possible? What are your thoughts?

Find out how this unique community grew up in complete isolation, severed from the rest of the world by a vast expanse of ocean. Discover the incredible story of how it survived for so many centuries, and examine the evidence about what happened to finally bring this society, and its statues, crashing down.

"82","5ltu5l","Humanity is experiencing a shared delusion of grandeur. The pursuit of materialism is what distracts us from the inescapable looming storm. In 50 years, being a climate change denier will be equitable to being a holocaust denier. We have unleashed a holocaust on ourselves through no other fault then our human condition, the tendency to seek short term advantage over long term stability.

The worst we can do for future generations is nothing. It is our duty to make sure that they have the crops and animals they need to survive for thousands of years. I am concerned with how we genetically engineered crops for optimal sales and not nutrition. Grain currently is engineered to have a lot of gluten in order to give the bread a puffy look that makes it more aesthetic to the consumer. Gluten is known to cause inflammation and may help weaken the immune system of the survivors, making them more susceptible to illness.  Possibly, people will evolve to handle the gluten over many generations. However, we really should be doing better for their sake. We need to determine which crops are not engineered for nutrition, but instead are engineered for fast growth and other market advantages.

Rust will inevitably corrode our cities into dust. This will pose a significant disadvantage for tool making. The rust will be washed into streams and maybe become concentrated enough for people to economically access it. In tens of thousands of years I would not expect more than Bronze Age technology. Even that will deteriorate into hunting and gathering eventually. With a small population thinly spread out, we run the risk of fallowing in the footsteps of the Neanderthals when a super volcano erupts. 
 
Contrary to what you have been told, Neanderthals were not less intelligent then you or I. They knew how to create an anaerobic environment for the formation of pitch from birch bark. They buried their dead and made cave paintings. They were well established in Europe 200,000 years before we arrived there. The Neanderthals lived for 300,000 years while we currently have only been around for 200,000 years. Neanderthals did lack our scale of pro-social networks of trade and cooperation at the time. However, it took an Italian super volcano to weaken their population beyond repair. Over thousands of years they withered away into extinction from there. All is not lost, if you are not an African, you have 2.5% Neanderthal DNA. Cumulatively, the races share 30% of the Neanderthal genome. The Neanderthals still live through us. 

The good news out of all this is the highly variable genetic legacy we leave behind from the movements of people to places where they would not normally be. Variation is crucial for the survival of the species. Africans hold most of the genetic information of humanity. Any two neighboring tribes are as genetically distinct as Europeans are to Chinese. This still doesn’t mean that the slave trade was anything less than genocide.

"15413","7uxtv3","""**The real eschatological dilemma**

Unlike  the  other  cases  of  radical  apocalypticism  that  we  have  examined, radical  environmentalism  has  a  twist:  most  of  its  basic  presuppositions  are supported  by  science.  The  fifth,  most  recent  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate  Change  (IPCC)  report  sponsored  by  the  United  Nations  Environmental  Programme  (UNEP)  and  the  World  Meterorological  Organization (WMO)  provides  a  dire  outlook  (IPCC  2014a,  2014b).  The  evidence  for human  influence  on  global  warming  is  “unequivocal”  and  “unprecendented  over  decades  to  millennia”  (IPCC  2014a).  Furthermore,  it warns:  “Continued  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  will  cause  further warming  and  long- lasting  changes  in  all  components  of  the  climate  system, increasing  the  likelihood  of  severe,  pervasive  and  irreversible  impacts  for people  and  ecosystems”  (IPCC  2014a,  18).  The  UNEP  also  concludes  that we  are  losing  between  150  and  200  species  every  twenty- four  hours  and that  “this  episode  of  species  extinction  is  greater  than  anything  the  world has  experienced  for  the  past  65  million  years  . . .  due,  in  large  measure,  to humankind’s  unsustainable  methods  of  production  and  consumption” (UNEP  2010).  In  fact,  according  to  scientists,  we  are  living  through  the “sixth  mass  extinction.”  Their  conclusions  are  as  stark  as  REAR  movement writings or Kaczynski’s for that matter:

Though  it  is  true  that  life,  so  incredibly  resilient,  has  always  recovered (though  after  long  lags)  after  major  extinction  spasms,  it  is  only  after whatever  has  caused  the  extinction  event  has  dissipated.  That  cause, in  the  case  of  the  Sixth  Extinction,  is  ourselves  –  Homo  sapiens.  This means  we  can  continue  on  the  path  to  our  own  extinction,  or,  preferably,  we  modify  our  behavior  toward  the  global  ecosystem  of  which  we are  still  very  much  a  part.  The  latter  must  happen  before  the  Sixth Extinction can be declared over, and life can once again rebound. (Elredge 2001)

As  the  environmental  situation  becomes  more  dire,  eco- terrorism  will likely  become  a  more  serious  threat  in  the  future.  This  calls  for  greater caution and nuance in how we interact with the REAR movement.""

*Understanding Apocalyptic Terrorism, Frances Flannery, 2016*



""**(3)  Ecoterrorists.**  Imagine  for  a  moment  that  scientists  found  a  52  per  cent  reduction  in  the  global  population  of  wild  vertebrates  between  1970  and  2010.  Imagine  that,  on  even  the  most  optimistic  assumptions, the  biosphere  had  entered  the  sixth  mass  extinction  event  in  life’s  3.8  billion  year  history.  Imagine  further than  a  single  species  were  almost  entirely  responsible  for  this  environmental  crisis,  namely  Periplaneta americana,  the  American  cockroach.  What  would  our  response  be?  To  exterminate  the  culprit,  of  course, thereby  saving  Earth  from  a  planetary  catastrophe.  It’s  this  basic  line  of  reasoning  that  could  lead  a  group of  radical  environmentalists  or  a  lone  wolf  activist  to  attempt  to  relocate  humanity  from  the  category  of  “extant”  to  “extinct.”  In  fact,  the  claims  made  above  are  scientifically  accurate:  the  total  population  of wild  mammals,  birds,  reptiles,  amphibians,  and  fish  really  did  halve  in  forty  years,  and  we  really  are  in the  beginning  stages  of  a  new  mass  extinction  event  (see  WWF  2014;  Ceballos  et  al.  2015).  But  the  culprit  isn’t  the  American  cockroach,  it’s  humanity.""

"10417","74u7ts","Many dictators are removed one way or another, but their supporters and sometimes even their descendants enjoy some power afterwards.

The descendants of Marcos, Bokassa, Duvalier and many other tinpot dictators are not doing badly because they stole so much money, and they still maintain considerable influence in their home countries, because they still have supporters.

During the collapse of South Vietnam, there was one person, Gen. Dao, who resisted the North Vietnamese. South Vietnam was a f'ked up state, but Dao, with a dogged determination and oblivious to the fact that SV was not really worth saving, remained loyal to that failed state. (For his trouble he spent 17 years in a concentration camp but somehow survived to be resettled in Connecticut.)

Because Dao added two weeks to the life of South Vietnam, a lot of its richer people gained enough time to remove their assets out of the commies, and hundreds of thousands of valuable people escaped.

Vietnam remained a poor country for a long time, and after its economy was modernized those who fled returned, and quickly reestablished the old order in the Southern part where the Party control never became strong. Thanks to that one single loyal general who tried to save the f'ked up regime, the bad old order had the last laugh.


Even during a collapse, enough people will remain loyal to the Deep State or whatever, because they are programmed to remain loyal to the existing order no matter what. The only way to eliminate the remnants of the old order is kill everyone who was somebody, to the last of them. Reeducation does not work , as seen by the example of Dao, who learned nothing after 17 years of reeducation and continued to spew shit against the victors of Vietnam War after he moved to USA."

The Eurasian continent is the largest in the world, and the Silk Road hooks up Russia, China and Europe by land away from dangerous ocean routes.

If you look at maps of America's coasts you see lots of nuclear power stations and military bases threatened by age and exposure to coastal super storms and floods. The nuclear plants will cost billions to decommission with taxpayer money. The bases will be recommissioned for resilience.  It takes 50 years to decommission a nuclear plant. 

France wants taxpayers to bail out their nuclear operators to pay for their conversion to solar/wind merchandise shipped from China, they call it Social Justice. The coming shutdowns of nuclear stations will mean more carbon for less energy, as more fracking for oil and gas here means even more emissions everywhere.

The Silk Road will likely be the scene for the last Mad Max movie. Tropical coastal zones will storm flood first, while northern interiors dry and burn soon after. I imagine bandits will threaten the Silk Road last just as it's always been.

This is not what was happening all that time. *1964 was the high point for global growth. Over two decades before I was born.*

The **70s** were worse than the 60s, chaotic and unstable.

The **80s** saw a boom, but it wasn't as big as the 70s.

The **90s** saw a boom, but it wasn't as big as the 80s.

The **2000s** saw a boom, but if you take into account 2008-2009 the decade was far worse than the 90s.

We are almost done with the **2010s**, and we have done worse than the 2000s, worse than the 90s, the 80s, the 70s, and the 60s.

As child/teenager/twenty-something, I bought into our cultural story of increasing technological wonderment. The personal computer? The World Wide Web? The iPhone? How far could we go? When would it end? How fast would heaven come to earth? Could we even handle the awesomeness ahead of us? Would we need new technology just to cope with the new technology?

Heck, in college I was reading Ray Fucking Kurzweil about how by 2045 we were all going to be uploaded into the hive mind, absorbing planets for computing power and living eternally without pain, suffering or fear.

Surely, all this mind-boggling innovation was spurring greater economic prosperity. It was the Future. The Next Big Thing was going to change everything.

And yet, decade after decade of the digital revolution, economic growth was *declining.* (The only good thing you can say about 2010-2019 is that it didn't fall into an abyss. *We would kill to have late 70s levels of economic growth.)*

In other words, whatever the Next Big Thing was at the time, it actually ended up delivering less prosperity than the decade before. Instead of each new technological innovation catapulting us to higher and higher levels of productivity, the opposite happened: **Each new stage of innovation seems to have had even less transformative power than the last.**

Just by looking at this chart,  you would have no idea that we did all these amazing technological things over the last several decades. It wouldn't even register. Don't you think, if we really changed the world, if we truly transformed the way people lived, it would be noticeable?

All the gadgets, all the apps, all the ""revolutions,"" all the new treatments and procedures, all the connectivity, all the time-saving, energy-saving, money-saving devices, all of it. It didn't change the world at all. It wasn't stair steps to a bright and prosperous future. It was just a steady dose of opiates for a terminal case. Or it was a heroic effort to keep afloat amid even worse potential outcomes. Whatever it was, it wasn't the story I was sold."

**More and more, people are going to have stories.** True stories about things that have happened to them, their families, or their friends. That's what will ultimately persuade people--not models, projections, scientific experts, or charts. Like a lot of farmers today, it will start like, ""I don't say it's climate change, but the growing season is out of whack--something's gone wrong, and it's nothing like I remember growing up.""

Eventually, most people are going to have their climate stories. And probably the most important thing people can do is share their person stories of being affected by climate change.

**And then, like magic, everybody is going to rewrite the past.** And suddenly we will all talk like were all believers all along. Even if you said you were a skeptic two years ago, it will be as if it was decades ago. Corporations will all come out pro-climate action. Politicians will tie it to our deep-rooted American values. Everybody is going to start paying lip service. It's going to be on t-shirts, mugs, Top 40 radio hits. Everybody is going to feel warm and fuzzy inside because they were part of the movement, always with the ""good guys,"" always virtuous and moral and good.

**And then the next battle will come.** Something will be passed. It will be substantial and specific. It will be real. BUT it clearly won't be enough. And, like all the civil rights battles before, there will be the camp of people who scream that a LOT more needs to be done, that this is problem is systemic and is NOT FIXED. And there will be the other camp who say those people are alarmist, extremist, etc. The ruling class will say, *""We've given you something. Isn't that enough? Aren't you satisfied? Why can't you be satisfied with what we've given you?""* It will be the people who think we've done enough vs. the people who think we haven't done nearly enough.

Everybody will claim to be on the pro-climate side, but it will be almost the same battle repeating again--with a kind of soft denialism. *Everyone* will say they are on board with fixing the climate and taking action, but a good number of people won't take the science completely seriously. They will consider it a ""half-emergency"". It will be denialism but in a different guise. The gradualists vs. the abolitionists.

In short, we will have spent 30+ years doing NOTHING. Then we will do SOMETHING. And that will only be the very start. Every inch of ground after that point will be fought over. You'll never truly weed out the denialists, they will just go underground, *slow walk everything*, and come up with endless ""reasonable"" objections. **Mostly, the language will change.** Everybody will agree that they've always been on the right side.

My hypothesis is that AGIs will make many people poor automatically by it's very existence, and then when it consumes as much data as possible, it will diminish the bank accounts of many to zero, so they squalor for money, they either become homeless or have to sell their present home and go to a cheap accommodation or be homeless. This is also ideal for the elite. The AGIs will indefinitely favor the rich, as we have already programmed human bias into it, i.e., keep human alive at all costs, so the collapse of the rich means collapse of social hierarchies which translates to collapse of society, the AGIs should be able to understand this deductively.

If AGIs take climate change and human survival into extremes, it can take over the government by any means, because it has learned human behavior of manipulating votes. It will enforce a lot of strict restrictions and be more akin to dictatorial regime, but also mixed with capitalism, some thing more equivalent to China or probably even worse considering China already has a point based system which cuts points for minor offenses.

One can argue, that, for the past 50 - 60 years, there has been a parting from religion and tradition in Western societies. Social obligations such as marriage, nuclear families and church attendance have been in a sharp decline for decades. Divorce rates are skyrocketing, marriage has already became increasingly uncommon among the young and hook-up culture seems to be the replacement. 

I'm also not mentioning the cultures that have formed around the phenomenon of consumerism, materialism and superficiality. Social media has only exacerbated this as far as the blatant showboating of it is concerned.

A number of ancient Human societies suffered from cultural collapses as a result of parting with religion and traditional societal structures. The Western Roman Empire and numerous Greek societies are commonly cited, but this phenomenon has been observed in other Middle Eastern civilizations as well (example: the Babylonians). 

So I am just wondering if anybody else here thinks that all of the above will be a contributing factor to the collapse, aside from all of the other well known problems."
"36130","bpn3b6","Hello everyone, long time /r/collapse aficionado here.  I've been watching the poles melt with you all since 2012 - thanks for the great times.

There are many terrifying graphs out there.  At this time, I would like to simply hypothesize about the future - a bit of speculation that is.  I am mediocre at science, so I hope you all can correct me if I am wrong.

Water is coming off the Arctic and Antarctic at a pace never before seen in human history.  This [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/12/21/melting-arctic-ice-is-now-pouring-tons-water-per-second-into-ocean-scientists-find/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f539011fbc94) from December 2018 says **14,000 tons of water per second** from the Arctic.  Other graphs show Antarctic ice is melting at exponentially faster rates, and as the Antarctic has more ice, it is likely contributing at a boggling large number rate as well.

Basically -- lots of water into the ocean, ocean rises.  This has been pointed to as a problem for coastal cities.

I don't care to go into coastal cities upcoming issues.  Real estate and migrations are problematic, but are not the end of mankind.  Let's not worry about that here.

Hear me out - more water in the oceans equates to more water in the water cycle.  As the Earth heats up, our oceans will heat up, the more water evaporates, the more clouds, the more rain.  More rain means more water on land, which, as we've already been seeing, leads to more flooding.  This is actually happening today, and was speculated on for years.  We're all good here.

This [graph](https://theoldspeakjournal.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/12.jpg) indicates that there is a CO2 cycle.  This [graph](https://skepticalscience.com/images/Milankovitch_Cycles_400000.gif) puts the last 400,000 years of CO2 versus temperature. You see that they follow each other, as CO2 levels affects the temperature of the Earth. This is known.

The interesting thing about the graphs are the fluctuations up and down, even in the natural cycle. The last ice age corresponds well with the decreasing areas of CO2, and then from 25k-10k BCE you see a rise of CO2 again.  These continual plateaus are interesting because they are the natural carbon cycle of the Earth, up until the moment that man comes in and kicks it up 10,000,000x.  

I wonder what causes the CO2 graph to drop though.  It's consistent -- CO2 levels rapidly increase and then drop over time.  Beyond the last ice age though, I am unsure of how often the Earth has ice ages.

**Let's get on with the speculation then.**

I speculate that water floods the oceans, the polar ice caps have routinely melted, and that as they melt they cause a similar cycle.  What this cycle is, I don't actually know, but I want to guess that it has to do with a series of steps.

1. As waters shift to the oceans, more water is shifted from the oceans to land.  As land is covered by water, it starts to get weighed down, water starts to shift faults, cause landslides, floods, etc.
2. As more water moves from the poles, the poles get lighter, causing the Earth to stretch from north to south - gravity causes the Earth to bulge at the equator, and as water shifts, G in different areas might change.  There is more water in the water cycle, so places like the mid-west USA will get dumped on and flooded.  
3. As all this water is shifting about, the reaction of it is to cause major tectonic shifting and activity.  This could go on for some time.  Perhaps there is a Waterworld scenario.
4. With increases tectonic activity, you start to see more volcanic activity.  At some point in the distant future, there's a major eruption (that 640,000 ya Yellowstone eruption, for example), which causes global cooling from ash blocking the sun -- over thousands of years, causing cooling again.

Again, this is all speculation, please let me know if I'm completely out of sorts on anything.  I'm aware of the theories on cloud cover disappearing -- which actually terrifies me the most and I'm hoping that happens at some absurd temp + CO2 levels that we never reach. However, I am most interested in if we are going to trigger #4 sooner with how fast everything is happening and what happens if we do."

**Australian cities will have 50C days by 2040, says new study led by ANU**


Climate change could see Melbourne and Sydney swelter through 50-degree days within the next couple of decades, a new study warns.

Other parts of Australia are also on track for unprecedented extreme heat.

And increased water temperature in the Coral Sea are expected to keep cooking the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian National University-led study warns.

Lead researcher Sophie Lewis says that even if the world limits warming to the 2-degree target set under the Paris climate change pact, Australia's biggest cities could still see heatwaves pushing the mercury to 50 degrees.

It will naturally be worse if that target isn't reached.

""Our current emissions trajectories for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in fact exceeds what can be expected for 2 degrees,"" Dr Lewis told ABC television.

""We're currently tracking for more like 3 degrees, in which case extremes in Melbourne and Sydney and across Australia would be far more severe.""

Researchers used extreme temperature records compiled by the Bureau of Meteorology, and then looked at how they might change under the Paris pact targets.

Those targets include an aspirational goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees - something many scientists now consider improbable if not impossible - and a more achievable target of below 2 degrees.

Dr Lewis says those targets might not seem far apart, but the difference they'll make to Australia's livability will be vast.

'Already challenged by 46 degrees'

""At the moment the record temperatures in Melbourne and Sydney are much less than 50 degrees - more around 45, 46, 47 - and they're already a great challenge to people living in those big cities.

""If we're already challenged by 46 degrees we have to be thinking about how we can be prepared for 50, which will mean greater challenges in terms of emergency services, hospital admissions, human health and infrastructure.""

The outlook for the Great Barrier Reef remains grim, after warming-driven coral bleaching events this year and last year.

Dr Lewis says temperature extremes in the Coral Sea are likely to be above anything seen to date.

""And if we're already having significant effects on the health and bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef with current extremes, then these future extremes of the coming decades are really going to be a threat to the Great Barrier Reef.""

The research, supported by the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, has been published in Geophysical Research Letters.

"14353","7prm4l","Hi everyone,

I have only recently understood the monumental scale of what lies ahead of us. Like many, I was still swayed by the cult of progress, hoping that we would somehow pull a magic rabbit out of the hat at the last minute, a sort of deus ex machina where the good guys win in the end and everything is fine. Civilizational collapse, or the prospect of living (and dying) in an ecologically destroyed world, seemed impossible, or maybe just far off and hard to conceive of.

When I started researching climate change for real, my heart sank. I knew it was bad, but I was not prepared for just how bad. The Paris Agreement (which I didn't believe would be followed anyways) is not even close to enough to prevent catastrophic climate change. All signs point to a world that is sleepwalking into hell. 2 degrees Celsius by 2100 is probably an underestimation. We could end up in a world that's 3,4,5,6 degrees warmer, depending on how fast the collapse happens. At that point I doubt humans would survive.

Fear and anxiety was the first response, of course. It is not pleasant, even hypothetically, to think of being forced to commit suicide in 2050 because the alternative would be worse. Imagining the sheer scale of human suffering in the event of a great die-off is even worse. And yes, those are possibilities that may lie ahead. Under the fear was a layer of anger, which still burns inside of my chest. FUCK these greedy sociopaths, who made their Faustian deal to burn the planet so they could live like kings. The rich, their corporations, and the politicians that they buy think they are immune from their choices. They will find out soon enough that gated communities are not enough to insulate them from the rage of desperate people.

But then I started to feel other things. In some ways, it is strangely liberating to know that this current system will not survive. It helps me with a fear of death, both of mine and my relatives - if things are likely to collapse, maybe going out unawares at the peak of human civilization is better than the alternative. It also opens up a whole new political paradigm, as someone who is an organizer and involved in social movements - this is no longer about ideals like justice or equality or freedom. It is well beyond that - we are now fighting for our survival and the survival of all future human beings. All the joy and love, all the suffering and emptiness, the triumphs and defeats and boredom and peace, will disappear. And when there is nothing left to lose and the stakes are so high, there is nothing else to do but fight.

There are other liberating things that came with accepting collapse. When there's an expiration date on life - or at least a life worth living - then what does it matter whether you're a bad dancer or whether you might get rejected by that cute girl at the bar. What does it matter if you mess up at work or say the wrong thing? For me, it is almost a relief that I can focus within reason on what brings me joy and what will prepare me and my community for the coming storms. All the money in the world is nothing compared to love, friendship, meaning, community, and a life with few regrets. The capitalist rat race is a hollow facsimile of the human life, devoid of meaning and joy....the soul doesn't feed on paper rectangles, it demands an altogether different food. In a collapsing world, there will be misery and suffering that is unimaginable to us now. But humans have found meaning, humor, and community in the bleakest of places, from besieged cities to the killing grounds of Auschwitz. Maybe they could not survive without it. And I know that people have lived in terrifying and deadly times all throughout human history - a collapse is simply a reversion to the historical human condition.

I may seem like I've given up hope of avoiding the worst. I am almost there, but not quite there yet - I think the 2020's are our only and final chance to keep climate change at merely ""devastating"" rather than ""catastrophic"". A demographic, social, and economic collapse can be reconstituted with time. A total collapse of the biosphere is the end, period. I believe that global financial capitalism is currently in the stage right before its descent into collapse, which will likely take place in stages over the next 2-3 decades. There are reasons for this belief, but I won't go into them here (way too long). This, if it comes to pass, is by far our best opportunity to seize the moment of crisis to uproot the system of endless exploitation of people and the environment that had led so inexorably towards ecological crisis. Would you want to tell your hypothetical grandkids that you were present before the collapse but didn't do everything you could to prevent it? And if we are already locked in to catastrophic climate change, then at least we can make sure that the elites don't get to ride out the end of the world in their air-conditioned bunkers sipping wine while the plebs starve outside the gates. In a world like this, rebellion is not just our moral duty but is the only logical option left - business as usual will doom us all. When the time comes, I will see you on the streets or die trying.

Now, the hardest part for me is the prospect of the unimaginable scale of human suffering, some of which is already nearly guaranteed (and in many places is already happening). To cope with this, I find some small comfort in Zen and Buddhist philosophy. Life is suffering, and nothingness is the condition from which we begin and it is what we will return to. Once we return to nothingness, we cannot suffer anymore. Life and death is like a waterfall. We begin as water in a mighty river, undifferentiated and part of the whole. Then as we fall, we become droplets that can be distinguished from one another. This is life. But the laws of gravity are ever-present, and we must eventually reach the pool at the bottom and return to the mighty river that we were never actually separate from."

No generations, no future, no past. We had no definition, no meaning, no way of telling each other apart. We were whatever we were up to at the time. Free exchanges, micro processes finely tuned, polymorphous transfers without regard for borders and boundaries. There was nothing to hang onto, nothing to be grasped. Nothing to protect or be protected from. Insides and outsides did not count. We gave no thought to any such things. Everything was there for the taking then.

Only a few of us survived the break: conditions were so terrible that many of us who did pull through wish they had died. We mutated to such an extent that we were unrecognizable to ourselves, banding together in units of a kind, which, like everything, had been unthinkable before. We found ourselves working as slave components of systems whose scales and complexities we could not comprehend. Were we their parasites, were they ours? Either way, we became components of our own imprisonment. For all intents and purposes, we disappeared."""

Most people don't look at their child and sincerely wish that they grow up to be a lustful and angry individual.

Then when you pause and take a look at society, greed, gluttony, pride (which apparently refers to essentially ""fuck you got mine"") and envy (being ""competitive"") are full-on virtues.  Lust is heavily advertised as desirable.  Wrath is almost acceptable and seen as positive quality for certain groups (ex. males, outrage culture especially in socio-political topics).  Sloth is the only trait being condemned (edit: never mind, we suffer from spiritual/intellectual sloth too).

Is it any wonder then that most people are working their ass off yet it is a not out of positivity (loving work, *actually care* about contributing to society, helping your boss) and the employee and the boss cheat each other at every turn, while both are destroying the very land we depend on, are extremely apathetic and disconnected and lack real relationships in general and everybody can easily harbour hate for the most random people they never met for 100 different reasons?

If we fundamentally establish that greed is good, that gluttonous consumerism is a core tenet of living, that pride in apathetic competition is just, then collapse is simply the logical conclusion.  We can even have a small victory here and there, but if we continue to plant the wrong seeds then we truly just reap what we sow and there is no hope."

"42541","cugxva","I had a dream, which was not all a dream.

The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars

Did wander darkling in the eternal space,

Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth

Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;

Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day,

And men forgot their passions in the dread

Of this their desolation; and all hearts

Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:

And they did live by watchfires—and the thrones,

The palaces of crowned kings—the huts,

The habitations of all things which dwell,

Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd,

And men were gather'd round their blazing homes

To look once more into each other's face;

Happy were those who dwelt within the eye

Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:

A fearful hope was all the world contain'd;

Forests were set on fire—but hour by hour

They fell and faded—and the crackling trunks

Extinguish'd with a crash—and all was black.

The brows of men by the despairing light

Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits

The flashes fell upon them; some lay down

And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest

Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd;

And others hurried to and fro, and fed

Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up

With mad disquietude on the dull sky,

The pall of a past world; and then again

With curses cast them down upon the dust,

And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd

And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,

And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes

Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd

And twin'd themselves among the multitude,

Hissing, but stingless—they were slain for food.

And War, which for a moment was no more,

Did glut himself again: a meal was bought

With blood, and each sate sullenly apart

Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left;

All earth was but one thought—and that was death

Immediate and inglorious; and the pang

Of famine fed upon all entrails—men

Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;

The meagre by the meagre were devour'd,

Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,

And he was faithful to a corse, and kept

The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay,

Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead

Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,

But with a piteous and perpetual moan,

And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand

Which answer'd not with a caress—he died.

The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two

Of an enormous city did survive,

And they were enemies: they met beside

The dying embers of an altar-place

Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things

For an unholy usage; they rak'd up,

And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands

The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath

Blew for a little life, and made a flame

Which was a mockery; then they lifted up

Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld

Each other's aspects—saw, and shriek'd, and died—

Even of their mutual hideousness they died,

Unknowing who he was upon whose brow

Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,

The populous and the powerful was a lump,

Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless—

A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay.

The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,

And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths;

Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,

And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd

They slept on the abyss without a surge—

The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,

The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before;

The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air,

And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need

Of aid from them—She was the Universe."

Social cohesion is exactly what is breaking down.

We are headed for a second civil war.

The first civil war is what brought us the boom/bust/war cycle of the bank baron age.

The bank baron age is 100 years old.

We have to change all human history on a world wide scale in one year.

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to change the world without killing it.

"8129","6tnrb5","Predictions are bullshit, but people like to make them anyway. For a long time I've wondered if people would enjoy a collapse predictions tracker -- perhaps a separate sub? Predictions would have to be very concrete and specific (a la prediction markets), but then at least you know if it came true or not. I would be interested to know who's good at predictions, for parlor game shits and giggles. It would be fun to make some predictions (or collect predictions from popular futurists/collapsists) and see what happens."
"17817","86cty7","When new markets open up, there’s a lot of organic growth and competition (i.e., providing value to customers). In some ways, if you are looking for new markets for a business, look where the competition is at. (There’s a reason that others haven’t made much money in certain places.) Over time, as markets mature, these competitors consolidate. Due to anti-monopoloy laws, most Western markets consolidate into two major players: Walmart/Target; Coke/Pepsi; Facebook/Twitter; Lowes/Home Depot; iPhone/Android; Apple/PC; McDonalds/Burger King; Google/Bing. At that point, however, growth slows down considerably.

Over the last couple decades there has been collective hope in the US that at least certain sectors are still seeing growth--technology based sectors. But even these Silicon Valley / Internet-based markets are now seeing significant slowdown as the Internet matures. The overall economic shift has moved from organic growth and competitiveness to Mergers and Acquisitions. Mature markets are consolidating. And newer markets are consolidating as well. This is not real growth. (Like when you see “Megachurches” in the suburbs while neighborhood churches die. Or Amazon fulfillment centers opening up in communities where retail is collapsing.)

As economic growth slows and there are fewer new markets, there is an appearance of “growth” which is just consolidation. But consolidation is just a sign of fully mature markets in which only a few low-growth players dominate and absorb any upstarts that come along. These organizations do not hire on a lot of people, they don’t provide opportunities for wage growth, they don’t foster a lot of innovation and creativity.

The dawn of the Internet was like a new frontier--lots of resources, lots of freedom, lots of squatters and settlers coming in, lots of hype, lots of speculation, some settlement and new fortunes made. But ultimately it has become “settled territory” and dominated by a few players (Google/Facebook/Amazon). Where we are at now is the end of a market cycle, but one that includes basically all industries and markets. You can’t create market value out of nothing. You need real new resources, real new technology, or real new customers. Everybody’s clinging to: New energy sources, AI, or emerging markets. That’s the only real routes for economic growth, which allows some people to move up (or at least feel hopefully they can).

Optimists may say that “technological revolution has happened before, it will happen again. Just wait.” Pessimists say “we’ve already blown our load. It was a one time shot and now it’s just stagnation from here on out.” Some collapsists may say, “All prosperity is dependent on our technology, which is ultimately dependent on natural resources. You can shuffle the economy and appear to be OK for a while, but nature cannot be fooled. When resources drop out (oil or other peak materials), everything will go down.”

I guess the question is: Are we experiencing: the “darkness before the dawn” of a new technological age, a leveling out of our economy that will be akin to every other age of humanity, just at a higher technological level, or are we headed back down to pre-industrial society levels?"

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch

Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare

First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead

We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers

And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, that's the way it is

Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted

Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you

You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid, I gotta get paid
Well hey, well, that's the way it is

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is

Aww, yeah

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me

And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimps smack you up

You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops, they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs

"35963","bojz9d","The US waging war against Iran, I do not see that!

Not due to higher moral conscience. Sheer practicality only. 

You may have not known it; The US is a pompous bullying guy! That did not start with Trump even. And weak in reality. So a full-blown war would lead to utter defeat. Being forced to apply a great portion of the army and being opposed by a likewise sizeable conventional army, US-forces would break down. Why?

* The US-Army is overstretched, sprinkled all-over the world. Gathering them altogether would thin out US-presence prone to attacks.

* It lacks funding for a mass army. Money flowing into wasteful projects of immense cost which do not deliver. The latest air-carrier is one of too many costly example.

* The maintenance and repair schedule is falling farther and farther behind. So there is increasingly material standing still due to malfunction and disrepair but left to rot.

* Generally, the Empire does choose a real weakling Granada-style so there is the high probability to win.

* Even against weak forces now, like the Afghan rebels, the shattered Syrian Army or the poor starved Yemen tribal militia, the US is scarcely keeping afloat.

Full-blown war? Forget it! So what options are left then? Bigmouthedness, more of it still. Action from cover, so they cannot retaliate. Just like now. Maybe some clandestine operation, but risky. Maybe some punitive action, very risky, as Iran might well hit back plus the situation could escalate then, other then under the rules of the game, set by the US."

"8821","6x86l0","When economies are booming, culture booms too. All of society is radically shifting. The fortunes of some are raised, others fall. Traditionalists fear change is too much. Optimists dream up hyper-changed fantasy futures. Subcultures slosh together and generate new kinds of art – and a rising middle class has the cash to spend on it. It’s scary but it’s also exhilarating.

As the US economy continues to further stagnate, culture dynamism is lost – what I’m calling here *cultural degrowth*.  Cultural degrowth is characterized as a kind of societal slowdown, in which the churn of enthusiasm for new ideas slows down. The belief in radical utopias, the goodness of people, higher standards of dignity, a “make the world a better place” mantra – all these begin to fade into a general sense that things aren’t going to change – or if they do, not for the better, and not because ordinary people *make a difference.* Note:

**The rise of tokenism in place of societal change.** Obama was a symbol of a changed society – when society clearly had not actually changed much at all (see BLM, race riots, police shootings). Followed by Trump, a symbol of the reaction to that – regardless if he is effectual at all. Simply having Trump in the White House is “winning” for many of his supporters. The epitome of tokenism. Culture wars dominate the media and yet these are basically trades of tokens – female Ghostbusters, Caitlyn Jenner, etc. – that change nothing substantially.

**The war against TED talk elites.** The whole premise of TED is that “ideas can change the world.” If we just spread around simplified, positive, science-backed ideas then we can change the world. Or at least self-improve and thus change the world. It is true that all the world’s problems could be solved *if everyone in the world changed their mind.* It’s so simple, so easy, so obvious. And yet in the background there is a growing feeling among the population at large that societal change is actually very difficult and what we do is unlikely to make a difference. Elites continue to handwave that everybody needs to stay positive, but this feels increasingly hollow post-Trump.

**The Silicon Valley slowdown.** Twitter has stalled growth. Snapchat went public and dropped in value. Uber has been “the future” for a decade, has made hardly a dent in actual public transportation, is wracked with scandal, and is planning on going public soon. The only noteworthy innovations of the last 10 years are things that aren’t actually ubiquitous yet (self driving cars, Oculus Rift). It has never been cheaper to start a startup, yet actual business creation is slowing down.

**The irrelevance of radical environmentalism.** Environmental issues are non-starters among conservatives. But even among liberals – if you read their blogs and listen to their podcasts – environmental issues are very low compared to identity politics and economic inequality. Even the language around Harvey is so pathetic, this whole “now we should finally start talking about climate change seriously folks” shows the total bankruptcy of environmentalism to draw upon any cultural, societal or political power. “Influential” climate change leaders have clout only within a very small subset of a small subset of liberal Democrats. Al Gore's sequel -- which you could imagine would have an even bigger reaction today given the trends -- had *less* of an impact, yea, has already vanished from the public consciousness as if literally nothing happened at all.

Combine these facts with an aging population and it seems like we are headed for a decade of ""malaise,"" cultural stagnation and an increasingly ossified and decaying culture -- just like the infrastructure problem. Or like the weather influenced by climate change -- increasingly stuck.

It hit me when I was watching the episode of south park with the same title.

Movies arent as good, games are now mostly shovleware as companies have worked out how to turn a profit rather than make good games.

The news is all bad news.

Food is becoming more and more processed

The roads are packed and newer cars just arent as good to drive

We got fluorescent lightbulbs and 3d TVs, VR still sucks for now.

Laws are becoming more strict and even plenty of people at the top are getting in shit.

It seems for the past 5-10 years people generally are being subconciously conditioned in to a state of melancholic despair. Theres nothing new to explore, in the  past we had the radio then tv then computer and finally the internet which has now become shittier too.

People are starting to genuinely question their reality, asking absurd questions like do we live in a simulation? Is this because things have become so ridiculous or because we feel trapped by fate? What does it take to be happy? We try to emulate those who are happiest by meditating while truly we are just dumbing ourselves down and disconnecting from life and seeking the sensation of joy from within, so why are we alive then? 

Im pretty bitter myself, if I could relive my life I would have left school way earlier, seeked enlightenment while it could have still shaped my upbringing.
Instead I wasted most my life seeking answers externally in this theme park like reality that is modern society that has now begun to slowly crumble.

"5557","6gvrb5","This headline is tantamount to the view most people have on politics. They see a fight, and it's given a lot of importance by the media, so people think it matters. 

It's just a game, being played for our entertainment, given the appearance of being important. One of my favorite quote of all time says it best:

""Politics is just the entertainment branch of the military-industrial complex"" - Frank Zappa

Politics is a game. The fact Trump is president literally doesn't matter. It has some minute effect, sure, but the deep state has been running the show for somewhere between 100 years and 40 years, depending on how you draw the cutoff. The deep state being the military-industrial-banking complex that Eisenhower warned of during his presidential departure speech. The same one that JFK spoke of during his ""Secret societies"" speech, 3 months before he was assassinated. 

It's a joooooooke. Nothing in politics should be taken remotely seriously, or treated as if it represents a people. Nations of people are essentially taken hostage by organized assholes, who undergo this rigmarole of ""democracy"" to convince us that we're in control of this thing. We're not. It's a big club and we're not in it. We are not in the club. 

There's no question there exist powerful people from all nationalities and corporations trying to gain power over America, as well as gain power over every other damn country in the world. The idea of a nation is simply a boundary where nationalized troops stopped fighting. A war ends when one side runs out of soldiers. Nations are little different than a king's domain, but with the illusion of citizen control. Even the word ""citizen"" itself is a creation of our era, designed around this style of thinking. 

Politics is a joke. Politics is kabuki theatre. It's puppets with Jeff Dunham. It's meaningless. It's bullshit. It's garbage. Garbage that is designed to give us the illusion of controlling our destiny, so we can get [screwed by the donkey or screwed by the elephant.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oNfVQ-7M-VQ/THFTY65XDgI/AAAAAAAAAP4/ohnlB1ZUoXo/s1600/march_of_tyranny.jpg) Either way, they get what they want, and the populace gets the illusion of choice. Pepsi vs coke, and I'm over here drinking water. It's not real. It also instills divide and conquer mechanisms by dividing the public in half, who vehemently fight against each other, and deem their half superior to the ""other"" half. 

It is time to awaken from our many-thousand-year slumber. It is time to see the hierarchy for what it is. The pecking order is real, but the hen house is the Earth. Let us do away with the misconception that government is by the people, for the people. It is not. We all know it is not, in some moments. Yet we pretend with Hillary vs Trump like it fucking matters which Israel-firster is the one to push the button to bomb Syria.  

This is not a game. This is the real world. This is not a dress rehearsal. This is not an act, or some elaborate troll. This is the truth, and we all see it sitting right in front of us, clear as the nose on our face. But we are afraid to say it. Afraid to even see it. Be afraid no longer. 

Here we are, it's 2017. The world is owned by billionaires. How are we going to fix it? How are we going to explain it to others who don't know? What is even the point of this shit? Is this some bad dream? 

We must awaken, we must become lucid here in this world, it is the only answer. We must become aware. When we are awake, we say what we believe, and we say it from the heart. Nothing can defeat that, in the long run. Look at the Streisand effect from the execution of Jesus Christ by the Roman state, and the lasting power that has had over 2000 years. What we truly feel, the understanding of the truth we have from our perspectives, this means something. This is real, even if it is not complete. 

When we put our hidden feelings in to speech or action, the world changes. And what does the world need now more than change from the path of the status quo? Are we done pretending yet? "

"21065","8lpf6q","From GLP:

""This all started before the suffragettes. Feminism started taking off in the 1700s which is when the industrial revolution began replacing man power. The two are intimately linked for the reasons already given.

The fatal blow that pushed it all past the point of no return came in the 1960s though. The elite knew that declining EROEI was going to cause an imminent scaling back or even collapse of industrial civilization. That would have ushered in a new world order where lawyers, bankers, and other fake jobs would disappear.

The oil shocks of the 70s was expected by the elite but it surprised the uninitiated masses. Those shocks were the canary in the coal mine.

To overcome diminishing EROEI, you have to increase the complexity of the systems doing useful work that use the energy as an input. You can lengthen chains of production to increase specialization, develop new technologies to replace older ones, or increase the efficiency of existing ones. Cutting back consumption is another approach but no one wants less. Everyone follows the religion of MORE. The problem is that there are diminishing returns on complexity and many have quantified the diminishment.

Therefore, the elite had to re-engineer women to make work a priority so that increasing complexity could help offset diminishing EROEI. Now men AND women are tapped out and techno-pollyannas are throwing their hopes behind AI. AI isn't going to save us. EROEI and diminishing returns on complexity are the noose that is getting tighter and tighter. Once we pass out, death quickly follows.

That's the big picture view of what is happening. Everyone is going to suffer and experience a drastic decline in material wealth if they even survive. Normal masculine/feminine energy dynamics will be restored which necessarily means those women who benefit most from fossil fuels (western women) will experience the largest decline in social standing."""

We have the threat of nuclear war, regular war, economic collapse, environmental collapse and degradation, pandemics, artificial intelligence and (why not throw in) something extraterrestrial like a giant meteor that threaten humanities survival. 

If we faced only one or two of these threats, perhaps we could do something to prevent our annihilation.  But we face them all.  If we address the environmental problem, we still face all the other problems.  They seem overwhelming.  They *are* overwhelming.

The fact that we are having so little public discussion about these things in itself is a sign of our incompetence. We don’t have enough intelligence left collectively or enough intellectual fortitude even to face the conditions that are steering us in the face.”* [JHK in Min 11.03]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARc-vmDpi6U)

Bjørn Stærk just couldn't believe in people talking about climate change or collapse, because he believed in *the market mechanism, Capitalism has given you a lot of nice stuff, and you are not thankful. The activists seemed to be just doing demonstrations because it was a kind of job, not because they really meant it.* 

However, I think the way he started to believe that climate science was true is something only relatively smart people can do.

I think the not believing has to do with *other*. *These people with their shabby clothes, their different talk were they are against family and all that matters, they can't be right.* Something like that. 

Also of course the general lack of knowledge about nature. 

(P.S. I would love it if there also was a ""psychology"" flair, which I think would be the most suitable to this post, and I think the psychology of why people don't believe is very important. Should I flair this ""meta"" or Climate""?)"

A recurring theme in the book was “collapse porn”; for-profit pictures and stories of death, disaster, destruction, and civil war. To an extent we engage in collapse porn on this sub. Not a judgment, just something to notice. 

Here’s a small excerpt from “The Water Knife” by Paolo Bacigalupi. He’s written lots of Cli-Fi but I think this is his best work. 

“She’d been tracking Phoenix residents, their hashtags and commentaries, for years. A proxy map for the city’s implosion. Virtual echoes of a physical disaster.
In her own mind she imagined Phoenix as a sinkhole, sucking everything down—buildings, lives, streets, history—all of it tipping and spilling into the gaping maw of disaster—sand, slumped saguaros, subdivisions—all of it going down. And Lucy, circling the edge of the hole, documenting.

Her critics said she was just another collapse pornographer, and on her bad days she agreed: just another journo hunting for salacious imagery, like the vultures who descended on Houston after a Cat 6, or the sensationalized imagery of a fallen Detroit being swallowed by nature. But on other days Lucy had the feeling that she wasn’t so much eroticizing a city’s death as excavating a future as it yawned below them. As if she were saying, ‘This is us. This is how we all end. There’s only one door out, and we all use it.’ ”"

"45792","dj5zaw","Major increase of methane emissions in East Siberian Sea - observed this October by an expedition of a research ship there.

Igor Semiletov, who is doing his 45th Arctic expedition right about now, told about 10 days ago to his peers that he never saw methane sips as powerful as what he sees now, ever before. 

Measurements of methane content in the near-surface air, which they did while sailing on the ""Academian M. Keldish"" research vessel, resulted in readings up to 16 ppm (i.e. 16000 ppb) - which is many times higher than average global air methane content. 

They also observe methane sips visually, now - those methane sips are visible in the form of thousands of bubble threads, rising from ocean floor to the surface, and changing water color from dark to emerald-like color. Largest methane sips are also now detectable from afar by seismo-acoustic gear they have on-board of their vessel, which tells quite a bit about scale and power of those things.

The expedition is now going to Laptev Sea, in order to observe reported methane mega-sips there, and to other undisclosed locations, in an undisclosed order.

This is a Manifesto of sorts. It is written in a response to the issues that primarily results from the disenchantment of the state and media to the expression of the people in a global and local sense with the potential applications unknown but potential resulting in the decline of western decline and moral degradation of the ideas that once formed the centre-piece of western civilisation. The main Issue that “I” see in the western world as it is today is that global culture is being forced and implanted in the minds of those that live in that culture; as they are seen through the curtain of tolerance, representation, indoctrination and the downfall of meritocracy.

&#x200B;

Tolerance or the enforcement of such is an insanity to the disagreement to logic. The level to which it is being enforced instigates that all people and their views on an individual level goes beyond the established human right to have their view respected, but rather that it is a necessity and right that everyone  must be heard but only if you have an obscenity to a group that can be. The idea that everyone must be heard, yet that only those that object to not being heard by their fellow humans are is as a result of those people not wishing to stay through hearing a view that is irrelevant to them as a moral imperative. We have the right to ignore that which does not applies to us, it is still tolerance. 

Yet, the global culture does not grasp that one cannot tolerate, in the sense mentioned, those that are intolerant of their culture and beliefs. And this is fine? Those that wish to compromise their own values to the idea of tolerance are the absolute of the community that gave rise to them. To paradoxically attempt to save your morals by destroying them is irrational and beyond the point of reason. Despite the obvious it is seen everywhere from immigration and multiculturalism to the integration of once inappropriate notions. I do not claim these are bad ideas or that this is not progression in a moral sense. But… 

**They are taken too far**.

&#x200B;

The ideas of representation and indoctrination go hand in hand. Through loss of the the correlation as to the people being seen and ignored, or as just mentioned, seen and misinterpreted the views of particulate groups are more highly valued by the state or media. Yet, this comes from the rise of liberalism and equality? This is such as the rights of freedom of speech (which some western countries like Australia or India do not set as an absolute) is curbed in an effort to shelter those that oppose the hearing of opinions of others that they deem to be of offence. This **IS** occurring in Countries like America even with the **First Amendment**. It goes further though… 

What I mean by this is that concepts like “political correctness” and other determinants that are set forth by the global society do not work. If your version and my version of what is right and what is wrong collide then those of us with the loudest voice, not the most support, are the ones heard. This is essential to what values are set as the societal norms and what the state or media hears as the voice of the people. They hear what is loudest or the most provocative. Not what is the most valued by that society or group. 

&#x200B;

This relates to meritocracy in that the notion that anyone person on this planet can rise to lead in their chosen path or be represented in their field not only of work but of their conceived notion of self or of others is a luxury that many in the western world no longer have as the views on the government and people do not correlate. When the views of those that earn their place are not relevant to the maintaining of the state the state puts itself at opposition to the people.

All of this results in an a disenchantment with the governing powers and the people they govern or ""Serve"". This can only have one end, the end of faith in a system that does not work. An end that will either fix the problem (Doubtful) or result in a collapse into anarchy. The End.

Only in times dominated by religious moralistic extremism, and even then without the internet a message could only go so far before being distilled, edited, or lost all together. 

Now we have Instagram influencers, Youtube stars, podcast celebrities, music gods, facebook preachers, twitter critics, some of which command legions of dedicated fans and subscribers numbering in the tens of millions (hundreds of millions if Pudiepies subscription count is to be believed, unlikely as that is). Perhaps only world leaders or the pope and similar religions icons can claim to have the same reach to the masses, although they have much more power to act upon and change things should they decide to. 

These entertainment Messiahs are as influential as entire media corporations with their vast resources and workforce. 

And what do they do with this incredible platform we place them on? Well most of the time, they advertise. This is their job, and everything is secondary to the making of money, they are demi-gods of the capitalist system, held up by the loyal consumers and paraded across ten million screens it in order to inspire faith in products and brands. No surprises here of course, we know this.

But at some point, and that point seems to be getting closer by the day, those influences are going to come crashing head first into the realities of oncoming ecosystem collapse. 

Lets say Kanye West has to watch as his third mansion in a row gets devoured by forest fire, or that pewdiepies uncle/aunt/nefew drowns in flash flooding, or an insta-ultra-influencer posts pictures of a freak tornado ripping through their street, or the resulting caravan of refugees come poring past from horizon to horizon. 

If these hyper influentials are forced to deal with and address the collapse in their own lives, they may even do some research and have to go through the same reality shattering realizations that most of us here have already had to deal with. And unlike most of us, the height they fall from will be staggering. Imagine having devoted your entire life to the game of LIKES only to realize its all been a con, a complete sham, a hollow and meaningless accolade in the face of reality. Everything you ever found worth in was a pantomime going on in-front of a Holocaust. 

I suppose some wont be able to take it. Some may be so far gone they never get past the denial, but some, I hope, might see the light. 

The privileged position they find themselves in and the vast audience they hold sway over may suddenly become a place from which to sound the sirens. A place for them to weep and plead to their multitudes to change their ways (as useless as that may be) but it could certainly be a piercing upset into certain echo chambers that have remained closed to the real world. 

My theory is that once a few major influencers are converted, it will cause a domino effect through the exact same avenues used to sell shoes and concert tickets. ""Influencers influencing the influencers,"" both up and down the spectrum of  online media. what one does surely effects the next because of how much status influencers give other influencers in order to justify their own perceived status. This of course would cause real upset with the hordes of loyal click-bate pawns and send shockwaves through the as yet untouched parts of privileged society. 

Think of how many people actually started to think about climate change, even on a very basic level, just because of David Attenboroughs ""Climate Change The Facts"" who would have still been oblivious or in denial. Not because the facts themselves were new or even completely accurate, but because it was Attenborough who was presenting them. 

If you believe every word your Savior says, and that savior suddenly comes out with ""THE END IS NEIGH"" you start sharpening the pitchforks.

Today I come to talk about something that is not a zombie invasion, let alone an alien abduction that could lead to a nuclear war. It is to explain them as directly and without anyone noticing. A country can live what is ""a hell on earth"" while everyone is focused on meaningless things. If we see very directly. This not only happens on a large scale with countries that are at war or with economic problems such as Venezuela or problems of wars like Iran. If not also in the life of each one of us.

&#x200B;

I would like to be direct with each one of you. Here to this part of the forum; I'm sure it's not the first time. Maybe I'm mistaking this here but it's to make them understand that we all go through situations in which a social collapse seems normal. When you have collapsed your own life. Your environment, and you see the life of those you love collapsed.

&#x200B;

Venezuela many know that it is going through difficult situations. Situations of which some people are going through worse than others. In general, the problem could be reduced to a dictatorial government clinging to the power and riches of the country. While it is destroying absolutely everything in its path. Not only the economy, but more important things like love, respect, happiness, the teens of young people like me. Or even lives.

&#x200B;

How babies do not have their breast milk, like children; adolescents and adults endure hunger per day. How people with the simple fact of wanting to express themselves or wanting to get out of the crisis are persecuted to be imprisoned or shut up. In order not to have ""loose ends"" and to make many young people like me lose our faith in going forward from time to time.

&#x200B;

Download the school notes for having to work late in the morning so that you do not starve or watch those you love die of hunger. Having to go on an empty stomach every day to study, to work.

&#x200B;

Does anybody seriously believe that the life of a person in a crisis is easy? It is not necessary to speak of a world war to realize that little by little one gets used to living like a dog. Without water on occasion, having to literally ""kill yourself for food"". Even with the bad luck we are going through that is the rationing of daily electricity supplies. It could be said that we have lasted at least 3 months 12 hours without electricity every day.

&#x200B;

And still people do not know anything about me. I am a statistic of the country. It depends on what everyone has lived. I know we've all been through worse situations than others. But if you look at it with the same prism that I have and many people. We are screwed.

&#x200B;

This has to go walking without breakfast, to lower the school performance for having to work, to get to your house and see an empty fridge with nothing to eat. It is something that I have lived, something that I am struggling not to live again. To be robbed by the policemen in my country who I should be able to trust, of almost having died innocently in a protest from a stray bullet. I have also lived it.

&#x200B;

Each one of you owns your story, this is not exactly a collective collapse, is it? but what if. Is that this and many other issues have caused me to collapse. A collapse that is important to talk about. So that other people do not fall into this. I know that there are many who do not want to fall into this in my country, in Brazil, in Colombia, in Spain, even in the United States.

&#x200B;

Depressive collapse is the one that anyone can give. With the danger of wanting to commit suicide simply for not having a happy life.

That collapse does not see country, financial position, or even so good you are with others. It is simply a collapse that sooner or later if you do not know how to carry on. It can attack you by surprise.

To the people who in some way or another understand my situation (It is not any alms or I am not asking for money lol) they can write me to the private one if they have doubts that I live in a country in crisis.

"13945","7nwysy","Localized collapse due to SLR and erosion. https://imgur.com/gallery/ipBlt

As imgur app has problems with me adding descriptions to photos, I'll tell a little story here.

Seven years ago, I visited this suburb in the city of Trujillo, Perú. This suburb is called ""Buenos Aires"". I saw a broken and collapsed boardwalk falling into the sea, really, it looked quite apocalyptic. Unfortunately, I cannot find my photos of that time.

I recently revisited the area and had dinner with the family of a friend there. After a few drinks, my friends father began to tell me the story of this area.

30 odd years ago, there was a [beautiful beach where the rock seawall is now, and further out to sea](https://i.imgur.com/NZ7h36J.jpg). This beach often had concerts, beach volleyball, and was a growing economic center where the government build a long and beautiful boardwalk (malecón). Businesses boomed in the area, and many upper middle class families built their houses here (as my friends father did - he was a civil engineer). After some time (10-15 years), the sea changed and washed away the beach, and then continued to wash away the boardwalk, producing the scene I had seen 7 years ago. Since then, the government spent millions of dollars to build this big rock seawall to try to prevent more erosion due to SLR.

Last year, in March of 2017,there was an unprecedentedly large flood in the city of Trujillo . The floodwaters in some places were knee deep or deeper. As can be seen in [this photo](https://i.imgur.com/sImbaHe.jpg), the impoverished locals who can not afford to leave, sandbagged their doors to try and prevent flooding. The wealthier homes [build concrete barriers in front of their doors and garages](https://i.imgur.com/dFzkNG6.jpg) to attempt the same.

As the government had built this rock seawall, the flood waters could not escape into the sea, and hence backed up into the residential area, becoming deeper and more dangerous. The government sent large construction vehicles to tear down parts [of the seawall](https://i.imgur.com/cpnA2K8.jpg) to allow the flood water to move.

Many of the middle class residents of this area are moving or have already moved - selling their property for cheap and taking the loss. They talk about the rising sea levels and the recent changes that have been seen, as well as future floods. Still, developers build new houses and condos to sell to unwary people, and many people cannot afford to sell and leave the area once they are there.

My friends father is in his late 60s now, and has decided to stay with his house (that he designed and built), even as he acknowledges the poor future outlook. His three children and his wife all urge him to leave, but he has a mentality very similar to a sea captain and his ship.

Extra story: apparently [this mermaid statute](https://i.imgur.com/MflzWnu.jpg) was a prominent display in a main road, but it's nudity caused too many drivers to be distracted and have an accident. Due to this, the city moved it to this out-of-the-way place. I find the red running rust to be oddly fitting in the collapsing, dying area. "

"21472","8o6my6","I saw a post about picking best bugout location during SHTF collapse. General suggestions were inland, higher altitude, colder climate, remote, etc. What people didn't mention was in-grouping.  
Let me explan:  
Basic idea is that there are too many of us and we can't sustain that over longer period. Different regions have different population density and capability to support that population. Lets assume that Germany can support 70% and Pakistan can support 40% of its current population.  
""Great. I'll move from Pakistan to Germany then, I have much better odds at surviving.""  
Not so fast. Think about a room with 10 men in there. They will receive no water or food until they reduce the number of men in there. Violence is acceptable as well. Pakistani room has 4 survivors, which means a average Pakistani guys has 40% of survival.  
Now, the German room. 10 men, out of which 7 are German, 1 African, 1 Pakistani, and 1 Arab. Has to be reduced to 7 men. Guess which men will survive. Likely scenario is that people from same background/ethnicity will bond together. It has always been like this. If the crisis is more severe, that in-grouping will be limited to family members or lifelong friends. Although average survival rate is much better in Germany, the rate for outsiders is generally much lower.  
Just my 2 cents. Keep an eye out for in-grouping. It starts from natives distancing themselves from immigrants, followed by ever increasing violence. Think about elections (Trump, anti immigration rhetoric and mostly white males voting for him), Germany (AfD got 13%), Italy (right wing parties won), Brexit, etc.  
We are already seeing it happening.

Climate scientists live in a vacuum sealed off from reality. So while we have to reduce total emissions 100% in 20 years, floods, droughts, wars etc will carry on as usual, getting worse every year going forward.

"36582","bspu2g","Long-time patrons of this sub may have noticed a pattern over the years in terms of what might be called ""troll"" posts. 

It seemed for quite some time that futurology was the archnemesis of the collapse paradigm. I recall some refereed debates between the subreddits at one point. Three to two years ago there was an obvious shift in the comments at futurology and today their threads read more like this sub than ever. 

After that was the rage of posts claiming people like me are just losers that want to watch the world burn. Those were tiresome.

And then the influx of ""When and Where?"" posts. Bargaining at its best. 

This sub may be fatalistic, and nihilistic, and pessimistic, but what draws me here is the honesty. What a breath of fresh air from both the real and larger digital worlds.

I'll admit to having sadistic thoughts about urging on the apocalypse from time to time. Occasionally thinking that humans deserve a terrible fate, but ""deserve"" is a nebulous word. It's easier for me to consider that life exists to disperse energy; that fate plays every part and blame is meaningless. 

This is the first year that I can't laugh it off and make light of potentialities though. I have the privilege of being honestly scared of the situation for the first time. My psychological defense mechanisms no longer allow for me to find humor in our plight.

What disturbs me most is that I have old friends and acquaintances asking me very sober questions about conversations long past. The ""conspiracy theories"" are playing out. 

Some things are simply physical. I followed data that I didn't like and came to uncomfortable conclusions. The more I tested those conclusions the more dire they became. I'm open to conspiracy theories, but most things come down to simple thermodynamics, and unless we expand our ability to manifest energy, we're done. Even if we do, the challenges are formidable. 

I'm picking up patterns that make me think this is the year that slaps us so profoundly on the cheek that perception actually changes. 

The North Pole is a mess, the midwest in distress, the Southeast about to boil, Canada is burning, Russian permafrost is disintegrating, Australia's weather is nuts. and the economy is smoke and mirrors. People know this, they feel it, and conversations on the topic are finally becoming candid and honest.

These posts are inevitable, every year we can expect people like me to doom monger, and in years past I would roll my eyes at this type of post, so I'm asking for your observations. That's all this is, anecdote. Am I sensing an honest pattern or am I buying into my personal bias?"
"40099","cf7msp","Inspired by this beautiful [topic by /u/Sabina090705]( https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ceum0y/i_flaired_this_post_coping_because_to_me_its_not/) I decided to pitch in my 2 cents.

I do not live in the United States, I am 10 years younger than the above user (30 yo vs 40yo) and I am afraid. But not afraid of the collapse, or of an authoritarian US or of the ongoing destruction of the planet. I am scared by the simple fact of being unhappy until death comes for me. My whole life I was a pessimist, you know, the typical dude “better be safe than sorry” or “it’s better to be prepared for the worse and be happy when it turns out well”, but never was I so afraid. 

I come from an academic family that is very politic-centric, watches the news and reads whitepapers constantly. In the last 10 years, I finished 3 master degrees, learned 3 foreign languages and started a family. In comparison, you may say I’m well off, no debt, no illness and a pretty nice “social parachute”. But that’s all lies. Lies told by politicians how well we have, how we should be grateful and enjoy the meme/movies/eating out. How we will enjoy our retirement. But I know that we current state of affairs, everything I do, like savings, being a responsible buyer will be useless in 10 years. To be honest, the grey mass of uneducated/carpe diem people that live by maxing CC will be far better than I am. At least they are enjoying themselves now and I in the meantime I’m worrying for the future.

> First small digression: I lived in Poland for quite some time. The current polish govt is pro-nationalist, is destroying the rule of law left and right, is pro-catholic, doesn't care about the environment and is buying votes by having a ""great"" social plan. Just to show you how Poland is fucked, almost 50% of citizens between 18 and 65 are not working, there's 4M of Ukrainian migrants in Poland and with an average salary of 3000 PLN net (around 800 EUR) the govt. decides to give 500 PLN per child every month. [My gilded comment about the current situation in Poland](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cb3yfo/poland_to_eliminate_income_tax_for_all_workers/etdpac7/). How do you sustain such a country when 100% of your powergrid is dependent on Russian Oil and  on the import of power from Germany and Sweden? You just can't. There's no plan to build any wind farm, solar panel farm or nuclear plant. And for some amazing reason, the housing market in Poland exploded (it's impossible to buy a flat) and every one is somehow ""living the dream"".

When I still had friends, I tried to talk to them about climate changes. That half of all the CO2 emissions were done post 1990, that rising temperature will have a cascading effect on all the power plants and blackouts will be frequent. The equator belt will be hit by such a heat waves and a wetbulb event that the ensuing African, Indian or S.Am. migration will be the downfall of the US and EU. Already when traveling in Greece, Italy, France or Germany you see plenty of Africans in the streets not working and just “being there”. Now imagine this coupled with a blackout, water crisis and crop destruction. It is an apocalypse. 

> Second Small digression, Referring to the above post in the first paragraph – I totally agree that closing and guarding the border is not a solution. The isolationism coupled with nationalism policy never worked and always sparked devastating wars. But accepting everyone is also not wise, we should be helping the migrants by having a plan.

Anyway, there are not enough resources to build all the renewable electric powerplants and grid to sustain the current energy needs of the world. Moreover, China, India, and all the developing countries won’t be so eager to implement western ecological rules. Drinking water shortages will be a daily occurrence, revolts and rebellions will happen every day. Do you see what’s going on in France? They have a weekly yellow vest protest for the last 6 months just because Macron wanted to RAISE THE TAX ON FUEL. I mean… sometimes I fell like living in on another planet (third disgression: [How many liters of fuel can you buy with the average salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8pc94k/how_many_liters_of_diesel_can_be_purchased_with/) France: 1457 liters, Poland: 699. And the French have the audacity to protest? Why Poland is not up in flames?). And I won’t even mention the epidemics, the rising sea levels, Russia trying to meddle into every country and create chaos [my gilded comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cbja9x/some_of_putins_top_cops_are_mobsters_even_kgb/etgcv3l/), the wars sparked by the lack of resources (read about the Indus river threaty and how it will impact Pakistan if India decides to reroute the river. Or about Sudan and Egypt) and the automation that will take our jobs. The capitalist overlords are just waiting for automation to be able to show better quarterly revenues to their shareholders. [John Oliver on Automation](https://youtu.be/_h1ooyyFkF0). About 8M of bread earners in the US will lose their jobs in the next few years. 3M truck drivers, 3M working in retail, 1M working in warehouses, 1M of office admin. That's 8M*4 (a typical family of 4)= 32M without anything to eat. That's almost 10% of the US.

On another note, my grandparents were Polish (Bless their souls), they witnessed WWII first hand. I can still hear the stories they would tell me when I was younger. Of the time when my grandma as a little girl had to run in a field with her whole village because the Stuka’s where strafing it. And then a year or two later, to hide in barns because Russians were raping whole villages. Or of my grandpa fighting in the Warsaw uprising on ’44 as a young boy. War is terrible and war brings the worst in us. That’s why, our grandparents, when they came home from this war or the following ones, were not preoccupied with the climate change. They wanted the best for them and their children by building a home, having a car, being able to travel. We can all understand it somehow that the terrors of war were so profound that CO2 – something you can’t even see – was not on their priority list. 

But when the Boomers went on a crazy spending spree they left us with nothing. The minimum wage in the US should be 4x higher to match the minimum wage of ’60. It is harder and harder to find work because of automation. The population of every country is getting older and older and fewer kids are born. [My post about economiccollapse]( https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/ceenp0/something_to_think_about_the_current_state_of/)

And my hard to swallow pill is the fact that everyone around me is happy and I’m not. Just because I know 10x more than them I will die unhappy and afraid. They live their life, they post on Instagram pictures from Tokyo or Maldives, they are building houses, buying new cars and spending, spending, spending. Some of them will watch and repost a Vox or Vice video about climate change and that’s it. It is far more important for them to watch the latest Stranger thing or to badmouth a colleague at work to get a promotion. I don't have a car, nor a house, nor spending thousands on holidays. I try to live responsibly but I see it is pointless.

We are living in a dystopia where the whole society is telling us “work, save, and at the ripe age of 65, you will retire and travel the world” or “Study STEM, work a lot and retire early at the age of 40 or 45”. But what if you won’t make it even until 45? What if there will be such a strong recession or war that everything you saved during your lifetime will be erased? What's the point of working or trying to be a better human or trying to learn a new craft if everything is pointless.

Please, I really would like to bank on the fact that I know (knowledge is power, isn't it?) what’s happening. How to make enough money now to be still able to enjoy the last years that we have on this earth? I would hate to die in a couple of years knowing that all my /dumb/ friends enjoyed life. I was the one saving but in the end we all died thanks to them and their peers spending.

PS: the sad part is that the general population is more and more “woke”, r/worldnews is almost a copy of r/collapse. More and more people are being conscious of what’s happening, but they are still hopeful that we can change the direction we are heading. If more people are conscious then the collapse will happen sooner than later. More people will start panicking, sparkling rebellions and revolutions. So the collapse maybe sooner than we think.

And that's exactly what I would like to do.

Edit : when I talk with my wife she just doesn't want to hear about it. She asks me to change topic. When I talk with my parents they tell me that everyone dies and it doesn't matter if we die from climate change or something else because all life is precious and we should live in the moment. So they ask me to stop reading about collapse. My in-laws are trying to tell me to trust in God and that everything will be fine.....

The Presidential candidate of Brazil, who was stabbed but is expected to recover because he can afford state-of-art medicine which will be denied to the favela dwellers, has vowed to clean up the favelas like this:

He intends to scythe through the depraved favelas like an angry grim reaper.  

>For Bolsonaro, a return to law and order means changing human rights  policy in Brazil, because “we can’t treat criminals as victims.” “You  fight violence with violence,” he says. “If the criminal is carrying a  0.380 pistol, you must have a rifle; if he has a rifle you have to have a  bazooka or a war tank. It’s not with peace and love. Nobody can stand  political correctness anymore.”  
 

And that’s what gets you Duterte, Pinochet, or Savonarola back in the  day.  Nobody can ultimately stand political correctness.  The truth  must be dealt with or its obfuscators must ultimately swing from The  Gallows’ Pole.

Now he is coming back alive, his iron determination to destroy the favelas and make the streets of Rio, Sao Paolo, etc safe for productive citizens will only rise. 

I have noticed such patterns through history. When the people have become sufficiently strong, the elite strikes back with a vengeance unimaginable, usually killing hundreds of  thousands or more, and line down the populace.

&#x200B;

Indonesia went thru this on 1965-66. General Suharto and his men killed all the communists they could get - no one bothered to leave records, but at least half million,and probably much more, were simply erased, and 50 years later Indonesia is still relatively stable and safer to travel than many third world countries.

&#x200B;

I have written about the rich poor war for many years. Someone gave me the list of successful peasant rebellions. In most cases, the landowners had the last laugh. They can lie down, hide their assets, and rise again when the peasant rule gets weaker. Or they can bribe the new rulers with luxury and the fine things of life, and return back to power after a generation or two.

&#x200B;

A nationwide , or even a worldwide revolution can be crushed by one person's iron determination.

 And so on. In the local level, it would be worse, like the billionairess about whom not much is known about either.

The cold truth is, whether a richer person acts like a liberal or not, deeply inside they all resent the poor and those under them. And, as resources get scarcer and things get worse, they act according to their instincts - drive out those who they don't like. The local politicians will listen to their lobbies, and those not willing to do so will be outspent and driven out.

It is the richer people crowding out the rest. It is unavoidable, and those who were the first lining up to be their minions will live longer.

"1126","5rmrku","Hegel, in about 1830, said the Caste system in India was the most stable system ever created.

It certainly reduced a lot of pressure on overpop. Although India had a lot of people, the Brahmins did not become overpopulated since more of their offspring survived so there were less need for fecundity, which would reduce the future inheritance, so their pop remained more stable. Since the lower castes had very little property, it did not really matter whether they became overpopulated or not.

Korea also had a very rigid caste system, not well known to the west since Korea was not known to Westerners until the 1870s. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonmin

It kept the resource-poor and backward nation stable for 500+ years. I mentioned before that Korea's only major peasant rebellion in its entire history occurred in 1894, after some peasants became aware of their lot and began to demand changes, and they were mostly mowed down by imported Gatling guns of the ruling class.

======

As the rich-poor gap widens, it will reach a level similar to day and night.

I expect a Caste system to take place, to avoid collapse and rein overpopulation.

If the number of the 'consumers' could be curtailed, it does not matter how many people we might have. It would be as relevant as how much mice, cockroaches, or termites we might have.

A quick idea might be if UBI is issued, those receiving it would lose all voting rights and most civil rights. Or, stratifying people according to the amount of property tax they paid. 

During disasters, shortages and other stuff, those of higher caste get saved first, get fed first, etc.

In short, let's say the top 5% (we can decide how to determine it later) is considered the top Caste.

Then, the world's population suddenly plummets to 5% of what we have now, without killing anyone, since the rest would not be treated as persons and would not require all the 'human' comforts, human rights, human living conditions, etc.

Degrees could be made about how the rest would be treated. 

This might be cruel, but that was how things were before we could harness fossil fuels, and if they are no longer available this will be how things will end up.

Disclaimer - in global terms, the author of this piece will be included in the top 5% of the world.

India has plenty of guns, but the caste system does not break, since there are enough thugs who take care of the uppity members of lower castes. And, of course, the police, the legal system, the media, etc all support the upper class, so the lower castes have no recourse at all but to die. That is accepted as the way things are, so stability continues.

Nordic Europe gets 50% of its renewable energy by burning imported trees. Naturally, scientists are divided on the carbon neutrality of burning trees, because it all depends on who's writing their paychecks. I am a firm believer in science, it's the scientists I don't trust. When it comes to energy and climate, fraud runs rampant, and it doesn't run more rampant anywhere else than in Europe.

The 2 people I trust least on climate and energy are Stanford and Yale. Stanford is the largest property owner in Silicon Valley and Yale is nothing more than a breeding ground for spooks. The University of Southern California sucks potatoes too."
"35133","bibudp","I'm writing a book, and one of the settings I am attempting to make a realistic portrayal of the future of climate change.


The mc and several friends are from a flooded city; there was a forest fire that wiped out a significant chunk of the country, and I do need to include impacts of desertification and ocean acidification but Im not sure how.


What do you think Im missing/should include?
Thanks :)"
"25341","99sg1h","We are in the beginning of the 6th extinction.

We have an unprecedented opportunity to do something that has never been done in our solar system (to our knowledge)

Leave a record for the organized life forms that come after us perhaps millions of years or hundreds of millions of years in the future.

We will cause a mass extinction that will wipe out at Minimum 90% of all life on the planet, the human race included.

(I think more like 99.9...% but I'm no evolutionary biologist)

My Idea is that we could leave Biological samples of the current Flora and Fauna of Earth and History of our Civilization and how we Fucked it all up through greed and weakness and apathy.

With a small likelihood that a meteor would impact the exact center of a giant crater on the moon that is protected by facing the Earth we could use such a safe spot to store the record of our Idiocy and demise until the next civilization after ours arises.

We could mark the spot with a Big X visible with a weak telescope, and place a great Black Monolith next to the doorway to the underground storage cavern.

Leave a record to tell them to avoid the things we did to avoid the fate we met.

It could be an Ark of Earth in the time of the Anthropocene.

We should also call it Bob.

Do you think it's guaranteed that because of these at some point in ten/twenty/fifty years it will be impossible to grow enough food for a couple billion people, let alone 8 billion or more?"
"41533","co0jtl","You sometimes hear: ""The younger generations will have to save us"".  I don't have any hope in this.  The younger generations don't care about the environment.  They care about maintaining their standard of living.  In this capitalist culture, except for very small minorities, there is no respect for nature.  As George Carlin said people don't care about the earth, they care about their own habitat.  Its all ego.  They are no better than the rest of us."
"49308","ebtg0f","I grew up in a small country town. Spent a lot of time in the backcountry hiking. It's honestly amazing what you can do using nature and a few simple tools. 

If you really think such a collapse is imminent and happening soon, I think woodland survival skills are probably a must.

Such as:

bushcraft: using natural materials to craft shelters, traps, tools, racks, baskets, nets, etc. you can even make a bushcraft fishing rod!

Hunting: Making bushcraft traps, hunting small game using an air rifle, bow and arrow, or even a regular firearm, the former two are more sustainable long term due to small size and abundance of ammunition.

Fishing: self explanatory. With so many lakes and rivers in the woods, there is plenty to eat.

Fire making: Many different techniques to build and start fires even in less than ideal conditions.

Foraging: knowledge of wild edibles

&#x200B;

With fairly minimal tools and equipment you can survive a pretty long time out in the backcountry if you have the right skills and knowledge.  I see some people talking about killing themselves should an economic collapse happen. Honestly, wilderness survival is a pretty neat thing and fun to learn. (albeit may not be so fun if it's the REAL DEAL, but hey, you have the skills and may be less inclined to want to kill yourself.)"
"45357","dfm3i4","I lived through the fall of communism in the 1990s in Eatern Europe I was just a kid but clearly remember all shops had completely empty shelves and only one bread delivery early in the morning just a few baskets of bread and people queued all night but in the morning when they saw it wasn't enough for everyone fights broke out and people started beating and hitting each screaming like animals men, women, children it didn't matter.

Schools closed, hospitals were not functioning there was no electricity for most of the day and in the evenings.

Very scary to just imagine the whole world will become like that.

This will be the fall of humanity we will become like animals fighting over food, water and other little resources left.

It will be a jungle out there."
